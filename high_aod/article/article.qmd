      Another author footnote, this is a very long footnote and it should be a really long footnote. But this footnote is not yet sufficiently long enough to make two lines of footnote text.

CE: cloud enhancement cases one minute

CEG: continuous group of cloud enhancement cases

# Intro

# Data and methodology

The recording of the signal is the one minute average.
Thus we will refer to this time scale as a cloud enhancement event (CE).
Due to the instruments response time.



## Data quality control

## Data selection

To preserve an unbiased representation of the data we applied a constrain similar the one used by @CastillejoCuberos2020. Where, for each valid hour of day, there must exist at list 45 minutes of valid measurements, including night time near sunrise and sunset. Days with less than 5 valid hours are rejected completely. <!--# CastillejoCuberos2020 There must be at least 5 h of valid data (Tests 1–7), otherwise all data for this day is flagged as invalid. There must be at least This work valid data 45 min of valid data (Tests 1–7) for an hour to be flagged as valid, otherwise all minute data for this hour is flagged as invalid. --> Furthermore, due to a systematic obstruction of the horizon and the significant measurement uncertainty on large SZAs, we excluded all data with $SZA > `r 90 - BIO_ELEVA`^\circ$.

## Clear sky identification

Use it to find some interesting days to manual check the CE thresholds. No other usage of clear/cloud characterization in CE.

## Criteria for enhancement based on TSI

Many have used models or some statistical method to determine then CE thresholds.

....... cite ...... Descriptions

We used as reference for the extreme cloud enhancement cases the extraterrestrial horizontal irradiance Equation


$$
\text{ETH} = \cos(\theta) \times \text{TSI}_\text{TOA}
$$

$$
\text{GHI} > 999 \text{ETH}
$$

$$
\text{CE}_\text{Threshold} = \begin{cases}
`r C4_cs_ref_ratio`, & \text{if $\theta \leq `r C4_lowcut_sza`^\circ$}.\\
\frac{`r C4_cs_ref_ratio` - `r C4_lowcut_ratio`}{`r C4_lowcut_sza` - `r 90 - BIO_ELEVA`} \cdot (\theta- `r 90 - BIO_ELEVA`) + `r C4_lowcut_ratio` , & \text{if $ `r 90 - BIO_ELEVA`^\circ > \theta > `r C4_lowcut_sza`^\circ$}.
\end{cases}

# Bibliography styles

Here are two sample references: @Feynman1963118 @Dirac1953888.

By default, natbib will be used with the `authoryear` style, set in `classoption` variable in YAML. You can sets extra options with `natbiboptions` variable in YAML header. Example

```         
natbiboptions: longnamesfirst,angle,semicolon
```

There are various more specific bibliography styles available at <https://support.stmdocs.in/wiki/index.php?title=Model-wise_bibliographic_style_files>. To use one of these, add it in the header using, for example, `biblio-style: model1-num-names`.

## Using CSL

If `cite-method` is set to `citeproc` in `elsevier_article()`, then pandoc is used for citations instead of `natbib`. In this case, the `csl` option is used to format the references. By default, this template will provide an appropriate style, but alternative `csl` files are available from <https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=elsevier>. These can be downloaded and stored locally, or the url can be used as in the example header.

# Equations

Here is an equation: $$ 
  f_{X}(x) = \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right)
  \left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha-1}
  e^{-\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha}}; 
  \alpha,\beta,x > 0 .
$$ {#eq-lowbap}

Inline equations work as well: $\sum_{i = 2}^\infty\{\alpha_i^\beta\}$

# Figures and tables

@fig-meaningless is generated using an R chunk.

```{r}
#| label: fig-meaningless
#| fig-cap: A meaningless scatterplot
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
#| echo: false
plot(runif(25), runif(25))
```

# Tables coming from R

Tables can also be generated using R chunks, as shown in @tbl-simple example.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-simple
#| tbl-cap: Caption centered above table
#| echo: true
knitr::kable(head(mtcars)[,1:4])
```

# References {.unnumbered}
