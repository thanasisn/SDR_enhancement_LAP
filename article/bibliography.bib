  abstract         = {Cloud enhancement events are instances in which the cloud pattern increases global horizontal irradiance on the ground above levels higher than would otherwise be expected during clear sky with cloudless conditions, and in general, these events are characterized by high irradiances occurring during highly changing transient condi­ tions. Even though it is a well-known although infrequent phenomenon, currently no consensus exists as to its formal definition. However, several studies point out to a need for a better understanding of this phenomenon due to their effects on mathematical models or photovoltaic systems behavior during these instances, as results show significant deviations with respect to the expected results in normal conditions. Due to these issues, the present work intends to explore cloud enhancement definitions and detection methods, for which a novel modelindependent, statistically-driven approach is proposed and compared to three other models found in the liter­ ature. Assessments are made regarding the main aspects of the phenomenon: frequency of occurrence, clearness index, diffuse fraction and its relationship with solar resource variability. Data from eight measurements sites throughout Chile, with different climatic characteristics is used. To further support the analysis made, monthly maximum expected clear sky irradiance for each site was estimated through satellite-based data as well as with estimation from ground measurements. Finally, the highest irradiances are presented for each measurement site reporting, the record irradiances for one-minute data thermopile and photodiode pyranometers.},

Observations of {SDR} at different locations around the world with different environmental characteristics have been used to investigate its long-term variability and trends at different time scales. Periods of positive trends are referred to as brightening periods and of negative trends as dimming periods. In this study we have used 30 years of pyranometer data in Thessaloniki, Greece, to investigate the variability of {SDR} under three types of sky conditions (clear-, cloudy- and all-sky). The clear-sky data were identiﬁed by applying a cloud screening algorithm. We have found a positive trend of 0.38\%/year for all-sky, ∼0.1\%/year for clear-sky, and 0.41\%/year for cloudy conditions. The consistency of these trends, their seasonal variability, and the effect of the solar zenith angle have also been investigated. Under all three sky categories, the {SDR} trend is stronger in winter, with 0.7, 0.4, and 0.76\%/year, respectively, for all-, clear-, and cloudy-sky conditions. The next larger seasonal trends are in autumn—0.42 and 0.19\%/year, for all and cloudy skies, respectively. The rest of the seasonal trends are signiﬁcant smaller, close to zero, with a negative values in summer, for clear and cloudy skies. The {SDR} trend is increasing with increasing solar zenith angle, except under cloudy skies, where the trend is highly variable and close to zero. Finally, we discuss shorter-term variations in {SDR} anomalies by examining the patterns of the cumulative sums of monthly anomalies from the climatological mean, both before and after removing the long-term trend.},

It allows one to compute (polarized) radiances, irradiance, and actinic fluxes in the solar and thermal spectral regions. {libRadtran} has been used for various applications, including remote sensing of clouds, aerosols and trace gases in the Earth's atmosphere, climate studies, e.g., for the calculation of radiative forcing due to different atmospheric components, for {UV} forecasting, the calculation of photolysis frequencies, and for remote sensing of other planets in our solar system. The package has been described in Mayer and Kylling (2005). Since then several new features have been included, for example polarization, Raman scattering, a new molecular gas absorption parameterization, and several new parameterizations of cloud and aerosol optical properties. Furthermore, a graphical user interface is now available, which greatly simplifies the usage of the model, especially for new users. This paper gives an overview of {libRadtran} version 2.0.1 with a focus on new features. Applications including these new features are provided as examples of use.

  abstract         = {Abstract. The Aerosol Robotic Network ({AERONET}) has provided highly
accurate, ground-truth measurements of the aerosol optical depth ({AOD}) using
Cimel Electronique Sun–sky radiometers for more than 25 years. In Version 2 (V2)
of the {AERONET} database, the near-real-time {AOD} was semiautomatically
quality controlled utilizing mainly cloud-screening methodology, while
additional {AOD} data contaminated by clouds or affected by instrument
anomalies were removed manually before attaining quality-assured status
(Level 2.0). The large growth in the number of {AERONET} sites over the past
25 years resulted in significant burden to the manual quality control of millions
of measurements in a consistent manner. The {AERONET} Version 3 (V3) algorithm
provides fully automatic cloud screening and instrument anomaly quality
controls. All of these new algorithm updates apply to near-real-time data as
well as post-field-deployment processed data, and {AERONET} reprocessed the
database in 2018. A full algorithm redevelopment provided the opportunity to
improve data inputs and corrections such as unique filter-specific
temperature characterizations for all visible and near-infrared wavelengths,
updated gaseous and water vapor absorption coefficients, and ancillary data
sets. The Level 2.0 {AOD} quality-assured data set is now available within a
month after post-field calibration, reducing the lag time from up to several
months. Near-real-time estimated uncertainty is determined using data
qualified as V3 Level 2.0 {AOD} and considering the difference between the {AOD}
computed with the pre-field calibration and {AOD} computed with pre-field and
post-field calibration. This assessment provides a near-real-time
uncertainty estimate for which average differences of {AOD} suggest a +0.02 bias
and one sigma uncertainty of 0.02, spectrally, but the bias and uncertainty
can be significantly larger for specific instrument deployments. Long-term
monthly averages analyzed for the entire V3 and V2 databases produced
average differences (V3–V2) of +0.002 with a ±0.02 {SD} (standard
deviation), yet monthly averages calculated using time-matched observations
in both databases were analyzed to compute an average difference of −0.002
with a ±0.004 {SD}. The high statistical agreement in
multiyear monthly averaged {AOD} validates the advanced automatic data
quality control algorithms and suggests that migrating research to the
V3 database will corroborate most V2 research conclusions and likely lead to
more accurate results in some cases.},

Recent development of weather-resistant automatic sun and sky scanning spectral radiometers enable frequent measurements of atmospheric aerosol optical properties and precipitable water at remote sites. Transmission of automatic measurements via the geostationary satellites GOES and METEOSATS ́Data Collection Systems allows reception and processing in near real-time from approximately 75% of the Earthś surface and with the expected addition of GMS, the coverage will increase to 90% in 1998. NASA developed a UNIX-based near real-time processing, display and analysis system providing internet access to the emerging global database. Information on the system is available on the project homepage, http://spamer.gsfc.nasa.gov. The philosophy of an open access database, centralized processing and a user-friendly graphical interface has contributed to the growth of international cooperation for ground-based aerosol monitoring and imposes a standardization for these measurements. The systemś automatic data acquisition, transmission, and processing facilitates aerosol characterization on local, regional, and global scales with applications to transport and radiation budget studies, radiative transfer-modeling and validation of satellite aerosol retrievals.

Especially the type of clouds, their high spatial and temporal variability, velocity and position relatively to the Sun, could cause events ranging from total reduction to substantial enhancements of surface solar irradiance. In study, the enhancements of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) at South Greece for 2 years are examined. We use 1–min averages of GHI, sunshine duration and synchronized estimations of cloud coverage and type from a digital imaging system. A radiative transfer model is used to estimate GHI under clear skies. For solar zenith angles lower than 80°, 4% of total GHI measurements are considered as enhancements. It is shown that the effect of thick clouds on the GHI enhancements is significantly higher when compared to the thin ones. We also examine cases that correspond to instantaneous clearness index values higher than 1 (Kt > 1): 228 extreme enhancement events are found including 5 cases with GHI values higher than 1367 W/m2 and a maximum value of 1420 W/m2. These results suggest that such events are common and should be included in the design and simulation of the performance of solar energy systems.},

Images of the sky conditions taken with a wide-dynamic-range camera suggest that this is not the ultimate value for our location, but that extremes as high as 1.7 {kW}/m2 may be possible. The phenomenon was caused by strong forward scattering of sunlight within 3° around the solar disk in thin, broken altocumulus clouds. The normalized spectrum of sunlight during such extreme events is very similar to the normalized clear-sky spectrum measured at Air Mass 1.4 and irradiance of 1.0 {kW}/m2. We suggest that the values exceeding 1.8 {kW}/m2 reported in the literature for a few equatorial regions do not represent the theoretical global maximum, and extremes of at least 2.0 {kW}/m2 (two suns) may be possible at latitudes within ±30° around the Equator, even at sea level.

  abstract         = {Using many years of high-quality measurements from a variety of radiometers at both 1-min and 1-s resolution, this study provides a detailed analysis of cloud enhancement (CE) and albedo enhancement (AE) effects on solar irradiance. This first part focuses on global horizontal irradiance. Various possible definitions of the CE phenomenon are extracted from the literature and discussed, in the context of PV applications most importantly. Based on 10 years of 1-min measurements of all shortwave irradiance components at a high-elevation site (1829 m) on the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, a frequency analysis of extreme events triggered by enhancement effects is carried out, using three different criteria to delineate enhancement effects: global horizontal irradiance (GHI) above 1 sun, and clearness index (KT) above either 0.8 or 1.0. This analysis shows that the annual frequency of these extreme events is extremely variable, and also largely dependent on the type of instrumentation (thermopile vs. photodiode). Although the scattering of light off cumulus-type cloud edges is directly associated with CE effects, three different types of CE phenomenon are proposed, which depend on the relative mix of diffuse and direct irradiance prior and during an episode, and on the magnitude of the regional albedo. The maximum observed global irradiance varies between 1546 and 1891 W m−2 at this site, depending on type of instrument and temporal resolution. The latter value (≈1.9 suns), obtained with a photodiode sensor at 1-s resolution, corresponds to KT = 1.62 and appears to constitute a new GHI world record. It results from the combination of CE and AE effects, the latter being caused by strong backscattering, itself triggered by a fresh snow cover over the region. If the magnitude and frequency of enhancement events are critical to detect rapid transients that can be harmful to PV installations, it is suggested to rely on photodiode sensors at 1-s resolution or better.},

All monthly maxima from April through September 2011 exceeded 1300 W/m2 . The slow sensor registered an annual maximum of 1413 W/m2 , while the fast sensor’s range was found insufﬁcient. A burst reaching 1528 W/m2 was registered in June 2012. Near the Equator, bursts exceeding 1800 W/m2 have been observed. These numbers are striking since the extraterrestrial solar irradiance peaks in January at about 1400 W/m2 . The phenomenon is attributed mainly to forward scattering of light in optically thin clouds (adjacent to the sun), which is much stronger for angles within 5◦ around the solar disk.},

  abstract         = {Enhancement of solar irradiance ({IE}) has been observed in many locations under partly cloudy sky conditions. Despite its notoriety, few studies have attempted to systematically examine the underlying mechanism for the event through simulation. As a result, there is no consensus regarding the causes of {IE}, nor an understanding of the effects of cloud optical depth and/or solar elevation on the event. Using a 2D Monte Carlo radiative transfer model ({RTM}), we show that {IE} through a homogenous square cloud is caused by the superposition of a direct irradiance beam with diffuse light scattered through the bottom and out of the edge of a cloud, through Mie and diffusion scattering. Using the {RTM}, we investigated the effect of optical depth up to 40 and solar zenith angles ranging from 0° to 80° on the {IE} magnitude and spatial extent. For the overhead zenith case the {IE} magnitude is maximum between optical depths of 2 and 3, with a value of 1.27 times the clear sky value. {IE} magnitude increases with increasing solar zenith angle, with the maximum occurring at a higher optical depth. The greatest magnitude overall occurred for a solar zenith angle 80° (our maximum) and optical depth of 20, with a value of 1.46 times the clear sky value. The simulations show that for optically thick clouds and small solar zenith angles forward scattering is the dominate contributor to large {IE}, but at increased zenith angles outward scattering leads to larger {IE}’s. Differences between simulated {IE} maximums and measured values in literature were resolved with a simple two cloud model to show mechanisms behind the production of {IE} extremes.},

Here, we present an observational dataset of global, direct, and diffuse solar irradiance sampled at 1 Hz as well as fully resolved variability until at least 0.1 Hz over a period of 10 years from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network ({BSRN}) station at Cabauw, the Netherlands. The dataset is complemented with irradiance variability classiﬁcations, clear-sky irradiance and aerosol reanalysis, information about the solar position, observations of clouds and sky type, and wind measurements up to 200 m above ground level. Statistics of variability derived from all time series include approximately 185 000 detected events of both cloud enhancement and cloud shadows. Additional observations from the Cabauw measurement site are freely available from the open-data platform of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. This paper describes the observational site, quality control, classiﬁcation algorithm with validation, and the processing method of complementary products. Additionally, we discuss and showcase (potential) applications, including limitations due to sensor response time.

By definition, these events are characterized when global horizontal irradiance ({GHI}) exceeds the extraterrestrial horizontal irradiance ({ETH}) due to cloud enhancement ({CE}) effects (e.g. scattering, reflection, cloud lense augmentation). Evaluation metrics are proposed to assess relevant features of the events such as uncertainty, event identification, and response time. The metrics were validated with high standard radiometers deployed at the Solar Energy Research Laboratory Fotovoltaica/{UFSC} in Floriano´polis, Brazil. The results were checked against solar radiometers’ specifications, and sensors were analyzed according to their performances. An {ISO} outdoor calibration, as well as a system uncertainty analysis and data response time evaluation, were performed, to assure results reliability. In addition, two extreme overirradiance ({EOIR}) events were evaluated separately, and seasonal occurrence of the energy fraction of overirradiance events was assessed and discussed.},

Ray tracing delivers very realistic in-cloud heating rates and global horizontal irradiance fields. The necessary performance of the ray tracer has been enabled by the raw power of graphics processing unit computing and from techniques for accelerating data lookup and ray tracer convergence. We used a case study over a grassland in the Netherlands to compare simulations with a coupled ray tracer to those with a conventional two-stream solver, and to test ray tracer convergence. We demonstrate that the simulated cloud evolution is insensitive to the convergence of the ray tracing across a wide range of samples per pixel per spectral quadrature point. Furthermore, simulations with a coupled ray tracer produce surface irradiance patterns that resemble observations and that strongly feed back to the evolution of clouds via locally enhanced surface heat fluxes.},

  abstract         = {The higher penetration of renewable resources in the energy portfolios of several communities accentuates the need for accurate forecasting of variable resources (solar, wind, tidal) at several different temporal scales in order to achieve power grid balance. Solar generation technologies have experienced strong energy market growth in the past few years, with corresponding increase in local grid penetration rates. As is the case with wind, the solar resource at the ground level is highly variable mostly due to cloud cover variability, atmospheric aerosol levels, and indirectly and to a lesser extent, participating gases in the atmosphere. The inherent variability of solar generation at higher grid penetration levels poses problems associated with the cost of reserves, dispatchable and ancillary generation, and grid reliability in general. As a result, high accuracy forecast systems are required for multiple time horizons that are associated with regulation, dispatching, scheduling and unit commitment. Here we review the theory behind these forecasting methodologies, and a number of successful applications of solar forecasting methods for both the solar resource and the power output of solar plants at the utility scale level.

  abstract         = {This paper reviews the most recent and relevant research into the variability characteristics of wind and solar power resources in Europe. The background for this study is that wind and solar resources will probably constitute major components of the future European power system. Such resources are variable, and {EU} plans to balance the variability with more grids and demand response. Thus, planning for the future power system requires an in-depth understanding of the variability. Resource variability is a multi-faceted concept best described using a range of distinct characteristics, and this review is structured on the basis of seven of these: Distribution Long-Term (hours to years), Distribution Short-Term (less than one hour), Step Changes, Autocorrelation, Spatial Correlation, Cross Correlation and Predictable Patterns. The review presents simulations and empirical results related to resource variability for each of these characteristics. Results to date reveal that the variability characteristics of the future power system is limited understood. This study recommends the development of a scheme for greater systematic assessment of variability. Such a scheme will contribute to the understanding of the impacts of variability and will make it possible to compare alternative power production portfolios and impacts of grid expansions, demand response and storage technologies.},

Due to this phenomenon, called cloud enhancement ({CE}), the maximum power of the {PV} generator can exceed the rated power of the inverter connecting the generator to the grid. {CE} event characteristics and the effects of {CE} on the electrical operation of {PV} generators were studied based on measured irradiances and cloud edge velocities. Over eleven months in San Diego, California, the highest measured peak irradiance was 1466 W/m2. In addition, the highest simulated average irradiances for up to 1 {MW} generators were over 1400 W/m2. The largest lengths for {CE} events exceeding 1000 W/m2 were multiple kilometers. These results indicate that even large utility-scale {PV} power plants can be affected signiﬁcantly by {CE} events. Moreover, the operation of three {PV} plants was simulated during around 2400 measured {CE} events with a detailed spatiotemporal model. The effects of inverter sizing on the operation of the plants were also studied, and the negative impacts of {CE} on the operation of {PV} systems were shown to increase with the increasing {DC}/{AC} ratio. During the {CE} events, the energy losses due to power curtailment were from 5\% to 50\% of the available energy production. While {CE} affects the operation of the {PV} plants, these effects were small in terms of aggregate energy since {CE} events that most strongly impact {PV} system operation are very rare, meaning that {CE} does not cause major problems for the operation of {PV} systems.},

If an overirradiance event is preceded by a long shade period, the maximum power of a {PV} generator can occasionally be much higher than the nominal nameplate power. During the overpower events, the inverter is operating in power-limiting mode whereby the operating voltage is increased to decrease the power of the {PV} generator. We created a simulation model of a 31.9 {kW} {PV} generator and used 12 months of irradiance and {PV} panel temperature measurement data to analyze its operation. We analyzed the {PV} generator power during the overirradiance events and applied various static power limits to calculate the operating voltage ranges in case of power curtailment. During the observation period, the maximum power produced by the {PV} generator was 1.42 times its nominal power. The duration of the overpower events was up to several minutes, but the typical duration was only some tens of seconds. The strongest overpower events occur seldom and their duration is only some seconds. Due to the overpower events, the operating voltage may receive high values, especially if the {DC}-to-{AC} power ratio is large.},

One such eﬀect is caused by extreme solar overirradiance events, which up to now have been reported in the literature much more for their scientiﬁc interest than as a potential problem aﬀecting the operational performance of {PV} power plants. Solar overirradiance events with a time span of tens of seconds or minutes are associated with the high operating temperatures prevailing in the ﬁeld at many sites where utility-scale {PV} power plants start to become widespread, deleterious eﬀects can be observed, which will negatively impact the performance of these generators. Using irradiance data from seven solar measuring stations deployed over distinct regions in Brazil, many of which are hosting megawatt-scale {PV} power plants, this paper reports on several extreme solar overirradiance events, with measured values above 1367 W/m2 up to 1845 W/m2, lasting from many seconds to a few minutes. Analysis of impacts and consequences from these events on the operational performance of {PV} generators are addressed, mainly focused on combiner box fuses, inverter overload losses, and inverter maximum power point tracker.},

The dataset was compared with collocated measurements of a second spectroradiometer (Brewer MKII) and a CIMEL sun-photometer, showing correlations of 0.93 and 0.98, respectively. A seasonal variation of the AOD was observed at Thessaloniki, with AOD values at 340 nm of 0.52 and 0.28 for August and December respectively. Back trajectories of air masses for up to 4 days were used to assess the influence of long-range transport from various regions to the aerosol load over Thessaloniki. It is shown that part of the observed seasonality can be attributed to air masses with high AOD originating from North-Eastern and Eastern directions during summer-time. The analysis of the long-term record (9 years) of AOD showed a downward tendency. A similar decreasing tendency was found in the record of the PM10 aerosol measurements, which are conducted near the surface at 4 air-quality monitoring stations in the area of the city of Thessaloniki.},
