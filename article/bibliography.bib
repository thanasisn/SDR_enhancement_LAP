  abstract         = {Cloud enhancement events are instances in which the cloud pattern increases global horizontal irradiance on the ground above levels higher than would otherwise be expected during clear sky with cloudless conditions, and in general, these events are characterized by high irradiances occurring during highly changing transient condi­ tions. Even though it is a well-known although infrequent phenomenon, currently no consensus exists as to its formal definition. However, several studies point out to a need for a better understanding of this phenomenon due to their effects on mathematical models or photovoltaic systems behavior during these instances, as results show significant deviations with respect to the expected results in normal conditions. Due to these issues, the present work intends to explore cloud enhancement definitions and detection methods, for which a novel modelindependent, statistically-driven approach is proposed and compared to three other models found in the liter­ ature. Assessments are made regarding the main aspects of the phenomenon: frequency of occurrence, clearness index, diffuse fraction and its relationship with solar resource variability. Data from eight measurements sites throughout Chile, with different climatic characteristics is used. To further support the analysis made, monthly maximum expected clear sky irradiance for each site was estimated through satellite-based data as well as with estimation from ground measurements. Finally, the highest irradiances are presented for each measurement site reporting, the record irradiances for one-minute data thermopile and photodiode pyranometers.},

Observations of {SDR} at different locations around the world with different environmental characteristics have been used to investigate its long-term variability and trends at different time scales. Periods of positive trends are referred to as brightening periods and of negative trends as dimming periods. In this study we have used 30 years of pyranometer data in Thessaloniki, Greece, to investigate the variability of {SDR} under three types of sky conditions (clear-, cloudy- and all-sky). The clear-sky data were identiﬁed by applying a cloud screening algorithm. We have found a positive trend of 0.38\%/year for all-sky, ∼0.1\%/year for clear-sky, and 0.41\%/year for cloudy conditions. The consistency of these trends, their seasonal variability, and the effect of the solar zenith angle have also been investigated. Under all three sky categories, the {SDR} trend is stronger in winter, with 0.7, 0.4, and 0.76\%/year, respectively, for all-, clear-, and cloudy-sky conditions. The next larger seasonal trends are in autumn—0.42 and 0.19\%/year, for all and cloudy skies, respectively. The rest of the seasonal trends are signiﬁcant smaller, close to zero, with a negative values in summer, for clear and cloudy skies. The {SDR} trend is increasing with increasing solar zenith angle, except under cloudy skies, where the trend is highly variable and close to zero. Finally, we discuss shorter-term variations in {SDR} anomalies by examining the patterns of the cumulative sums of monthly anomalies from the climatological mean, both before and after removing the long-term trend.},

It allows one to compute (polarized) radiances, irradiance, and actinic fluxes in the solar and thermal spectral regions. {libRadtran} has been used for various applications, including remote sensing of clouds, aerosols and trace gases in the Earth's atmosphere, climate studies, e.g., for the calculation of radiative forcing due to different atmospheric components, for {UV} forecasting, the calculation of photolysis frequencies, and for remote sensing of other planets in our solar system. The package has been described in Mayer and Kylling (2005). Since then several new features have been included, for example polarization, Raman scattering, a new molecular gas absorption parameterization, and several new parameterizations of cloud and aerosol optical properties. Furthermore, a graphical user interface is now available, which greatly simplifies the usage of the model, especially for new users. This paper gives an overview of {libRadtran} version 2.0.1 with a focus on new features. Applications including these new features are provided as examples of use.

  abstract         = {Abstract. The Aerosol Robotic Network ({AERONET}) has provided highly
accurate, ground-truth measurements of the aerosol optical depth ({AOD}) using
Cimel Electronique Sun–sky radiometers for more than 25 years. In Version 2 (V2)
of the {AERONET} database, the near-real-time {AOD} was semiautomatically
quality controlled utilizing mainly cloud-screening methodology, while
additional {AOD} data contaminated by clouds or affected by instrument
anomalies were removed manually before attaining quality-assured status
(Level 2.0). The large growth in the number of {AERONET} sites over the past
25 years resulted in significant burden to the manual quality control of millions
of measurements in a consistent manner. The {AERONET} Version 3 (V3) algorithm
provides fully automatic cloud screening and instrument anomaly quality
controls. All of these new algorithm updates apply to near-real-time data as
well as post-field-deployment processed data, and {AERONET} reprocessed the
database in 2018. A full algorithm redevelopment provided the opportunity to
improve data inputs and corrections such as unique filter-specific
temperature characterizations for all visible and near-infrared wavelengths,
updated gaseous and water vapor absorption coefficients, and ancillary data
sets. The Level 2.0 {AOD} quality-assured data set is now available within a
month after post-field calibration, reducing the lag time from up to several
months. Near-real-time estimated uncertainty is determined using data
qualified as V3 Level 2.0 {AOD} and considering the difference between the {AOD}
computed with the pre-field calibration and {AOD} computed with pre-field and
post-field calibration. This assessment provides a near-real-time
uncertainty estimate for which average differences of {AOD} suggest a +0.02 bias
and one sigma uncertainty of 0.02, spectrally, but the bias and uncertainty
can be significantly larger for specific instrument deployments. Long-term
monthly averages analyzed for the entire V3 and V2 databases produced
average differences (V3–V2) of +0.002 with a ±0.02 {SD} (standard
deviation), yet monthly averages calculated using time-matched observations
in both databases were analyzed to compute an average difference of −0.002
with a ±0.004 {SD}. The high statistical agreement in
multiyear monthly averaged {AOD} validates the advanced automatic data
quality control algorithms and suggests that migrating research to the
V3 database will corroborate most V2 research conclusions and likely lead to
more accurate results in some cases.},

Recent development of weather-resistant automatic sun and sky scanning spectral radiometers enable frequent measurements of atmospheric aerosol optical properties and precipitable water at remote sites. Transmission of automatic measurements via the geostationary satellites GOES and METEOSATS ́Data Collection Systems allows reception and processing in near real-time from approximately 75% of the Earthś surface and with the expected addition of GMS, the coverage will increase to 90% in 1998. NASA developed a UNIX-based near real-time processing, display and analysis system providing internet access to the emerging global database. Information on the system is available on the project homepage, http://spamer.gsfc.nasa.gov. The philosophy of an open access database, centralized processing and a user-friendly graphical interface has contributed to the growth of international cooperation for ground-based aerosol monitoring and imposes a standardization for these measurements. The systemś automatic data acquisition, transmission, and processing facilitates aerosol characterization on local, regional, and global scales with applications to transport and radiation budget studies, radiative transfer-modeling and validation of satellite aerosol retrievals.

usually appropriate for U .S. Standard conditions. Because the entire profile set is preferen-
tially based on available measurements, explicit photochemical consilstency between the different
species has not been maintained},

  abstract         = {The Sun is the star we can observe with the highest spectral resolution and signal-to-noise. From studying the infrared spectrum we can learn about the Sun, about stars in general, and about atomic and molecular spectroscopy. We discuss the computer programs for spectrum synthesis, the infrared flux and central intensity atlases of the solar spectrum, and the atomic and molecular line data. Considerable work is still required to improve the observations and to improve the line data.},
