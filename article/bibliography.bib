  abstract         = {Cloud enhancement events are instances in which the cloud pattern increases global horizontal irradiance on the ground above levels higher than would otherwise be expected during clear sky with cloudless conditions, and in general, these events are characterized by high irradiances occurring during highly changing transient condi­ tions. Even though it is a well-known although infrequent phenomenon, currently no consensus exists as to its formal definition. However, several studies point out to a need for a better understanding of this phenomenon due to their effects on mathematical models or photovoltaic systems behavior during these instances, as results show significant deviations with respect to the expected results in normal conditions. Due to these issues, the present work intends to explore cloud enhancement definitions and detection methods, for which a novel modelindependent, statistically-driven approach is proposed and compared to three other models found in the liter­ ature. Assessments are made regarding the main aspects of the phenomenon: frequency of occurrence, clearness index, diffuse fraction and its relationship with solar resource variability. Data from eight measurements sites throughout Chile, with different climatic characteristics is used. To further support the analysis made, monthly maximum expected clear sky irradiance for each site was estimated through satellite-based data as well as with estimation from ground measurements. Finally, the highest irradiances are presented for each measurement site reporting, the record irradiances for one-minute data thermopile and photodiode pyranometers.},

  abstract         = {The shortwave downward solar irradiance ({SDR}) is an important factor that drives climate processes and energy production and can affect all living organisms. Observations of {SDR} at different locations around the world with different environmental characteristics have been used to investigate its long-term variability and trends at different time scales. Periods of positive trends are referred to as brightening periods and of negative trends as dimming periods. In this study we have used 30 years of pyranometer data in Thessaloniki, Greece, to investigate the variability of {SDR} under three types of sky conditions (clear-, cloudy- and all-sky). The clear-sky data were identiﬁed by applying a cloud screening algorithm. We have found a positive trend of 0.38\%/year for all-sky, ∼0.1\%/year for clear-sky, and 0.41\%/year for cloudy conditions. The consistency of these trends, their seasonal variability, and the effect of the solar zenith angle have also been investigated. Under all three sky categories, the {SDR} trend is stronger in winter, with 0.7, 0.4, and 0.76\%/year, respectively, for all-, clear-, and cloudy-sky conditions. The next larger seasonal trends are in autumn—0.42 and 0.19\%/year, for all and cloudy skies, respectively. The rest of the seasonal trends are signiﬁcant smaller, close to zero, with a negative values in summer, for clear and cloudy skies. The {SDR} trend is increasing with increasing solar zenith angle, except under cloudy skies, where the trend is highly variable and close to zero. Finally, we discuss shorter-term variations in {SDR} anomalies by examining the patterns of the cumulative sums of monthly anomalies from the climatological mean, both before and after removing the long-term trend.},
