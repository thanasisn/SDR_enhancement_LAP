CE mechanism

<!-- Define CE and ECE -->
In this study, we define as cloud enhancement events (CE) the cases when the measured
global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at ground level, exceeds the expected value under
clear-sky conditions.
Similar, we define the extreme cloud enhancement events (ECE), the cases when GHI,
exceeds the Total Solar Irradiance on horizontal plane at ground level.
Although the duration of these bursts varies form instantaneous to several minutes,
here we are constrained by the recorded data, to one-minute steps.

# Data and methodology

## GHI data

Our monitoring site is operating in the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics of the
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (\(40^\circ\,38'\,\)N,
\(22^\circ\,57'\,\)E, \(80\,\)m\ a.s.l.).
In this study we present data from the period
`r strftime(min(ST_daily$Date), "%d\\ %B %Y")` to
`r strftime(max(ST_daily$Date), "%d\\ %B %Y")`.

<!-- Instrument -->
The GHI data were measured with a Kipp\ & Zonen CM-21 pyranometer.
During the study period, the pyranometer was independently calibrated three times at
the Meteorologisches Observatorium Lindenberg, DWD, verifying that the stability of
the instrument’s sensitivity was better than $0.7\%$ relative to the initial
calibration by the manufacturer.

<!-- Measurements -->
For the acquisition of radiometric data, the signal of the pyranometer was sampled
at a rate of $1\,\text{Hz}$.
The mean and the standard deviation of these samples were calculated and recorded
every minute.
The measurements were corrected for the zero offset ("dark signal" in volts), which
was calculated by averaging all measurements recorded for a period of $3\,\text{h}$,
before (morning) or after (evening) the Sun reaches an elevation angle of $-10^\circ$.
The signal was converted to irradiance using a ramped value of the instrument’s
sensitivity between subsequent calibrations.

<!-- Radiation data quality check -->
To  further improve the quality of the irradiance data, a manual screening was
performed to remove inconsistent and erroneous recordings that can occur
stochastically or systematically during the continuous operation of the instruments.
The manual screening was aided by a radiation data quality assurance procedure,
adjusted for the site, which was based on the methods of Long and Shi\ [@Long2006; @Long2008a].
Thus, problematic recordings have been excluded from further processing.
Although it is impossible to detect all false data, the large number of available
data, and the aggregation scheme we used, ensures the quality of the radiation
measurements used in this study.

<!-- Data selection -->
To preserve an unbiased representation of the data we applied a constrain similar
the one used by @CastillejoCuberos2020. Where, for each valid hour of day, there
must exist at list 45 minutes of valid measurements, including night time near
sunrise and sunset. Days with less than 5 valid hours are rejected completely.
<!--# CastillejoCuberos2020 There must be at least 5 h of valid data (Tests 1–7),
otherwise all data for this day is flagged as invalid. There must be at least This
work valid data 45 min of valid data (Tests 1–7) for an hour to be flagged as valid,
otherwise all minute data for this hour is flagged as invalid. -->
Furthermore, due to the significant measurement uncertainty when the Sun is near the
horizon, and to some systematic obstructions by nearby buildings, we have excluded
all measurements with solar zenith angle (SZA) greater than $`r 90-BIO_ELEVA`^\circ$.



In this study, we evaluated the effects of the clouds on th

  - sky cam
  - chp1
  - cm21
  - cimel
- CSid tool


The recording of the signal is the one minute average.
Thus we will refer to this time scale as a cloud enhancement event (CE).








## Clear Sky Irradiance

In order to identify CE cases, we need an approximation of the expected clear sky GHI
for the whole period of the study, with a temporal resolution of one minute.  Because
of the lack of exact data about atmospheric factors, responsible for the attenuation
of the solar radiation in the atmosphere, we can not recreate a minute by minute
representation of the reference radiation. Thus, we used some climatological data
with a radiation transfer model.

We decided to use the Libradtran [@Emde2016] radiation transfer model, to modeled
the clear sky equivalent of GHI, with monthly climatological data of AOD and water
column from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) [@Giles2019; @Buis1998].  Our site
participates in AERONET, where we operate a Cimel photometer, colocated to
the CM-21 pyranometer, since 2003

For the production of .....

We also used the Sun's total solar irradiance from NOAA [@Coddington2005] and the
Earth - Sun distance calculated by Astropy [@AstropyCollaboration2022].  We simulated
the clear sky radiation, using the solar radiation spectrum of @Kurucz1994 in the
range $280$ to $2500\,\text{nm}$, with a SZA step of $0.2^\circ$.  For the
atmospheric characteristics, we used combinations of AOD at $500\,\text{nm}$
($t_{500\text{nm}}$) and additional offsets of $\pm1$ and $\pm2\sigma$, water column
($w_h$) with offsets of $\pm1$ and $\pm2\sigma$, and applied it to two atmospheric
profiles "AFGL atmospheric constituent profile, midlatitude summer" (afglms) and
"AFGL atmospheric constituent profile, midlatitude winter" (afglmw) [@Anderson1986].
Thus, we were able to emulate different atmospheric condition and level of
atmospheric clearness for the climatological conditions of the site.

Furthermore, to account for the Sun's variability in our one-minute GHI measurements,
we adjusted the model's input spectrum integral to the one of the the TSI provided by
NOAA.  Finally, we adjusted for the effect of the Sun - Earth distance, and
calculated the clear sky irradiance value at the horizontal plane by using the cosine
of the corresponding interpolated SZA.  For each period of the year, we used the
appropriate atmospheric profile (afglms or afglmw).  Thus, the modelled GHI_modeld we
can directly compare each measured one minute value of GHI, with the expected clear
sky radiation.

- rte_solver  disort
- geometry   pseudospherical
- mol_abs LOWTRAN

Of course, have to choose which atmospheric conditions qualify as a good clear sky analogous radiation.


After some evaluation of the modelled radiation in different atmospheric conditions, in relation to the GHI data, we choose as representative of the clear sky radiation, the case with $t_{\text{cs}} = t_{500\text{nm}} - 1\sigma$ and $w_{h\text{cs}} = w_h - 1\sigma$.

Which is an expected result as these values represent an typical atmosphere in Thessaloniki with low load of aerosols and humidity, which are the main factor that attenuate the GHI, excluding clouds.



## Thresholds investigation

The use of the actual modeled values of clear sky GHI can not provide us with a
robust method to distinguish the CE cases, due to the limited accuracy of the input
data. Our main focus was to positively identify over irradiance events from CEs,
thus we used a relative factor, to create an upper envelope of the clear sky
irradiance, above which, any GHI value can safely attributed to CE.

To select the exact values of the thresholds (Equation \ref{eq:CE4}), we implemented
manual inspection of the CE identification, on specially selected days from the whole
dataset.  We used seven sets of selected days, with characteristics relevant to the
efficiency of the identification threshold.  These sets were  random groups of about
20 to 30 days with the following characteristics:
(a) the largest over irradiance CE events,
(b) the largest daily total over irradiance,
(c) without clouds (by implementing a clear sky identification algorithm as discussed in @Natsis2023),
(d) without clouds and without EC events,
(e) with at least $60\%$ of the day length without clouds and some EC events,
(h) random days and
(i) some manual selected days that were included during the manual inspection.

<!-- - some manual selected days that were included during the manual inspection -->
<!-- - 20 days with the largest over irradiance CE events -->
<!-- - 30 days with largest total over irradiance -->
<!-- - 20 days without clouds (CSid) @Natsis2023 -->
<!-- - any day without clouds and EC events -->
<!-- - 20 days with at least 60% of day length without clouds and some EC events -->
<!-- - 30 random days -->
<!-- - some manual selected days that were included during the manual inspection -->

Where it was needed, for some of edge cases, we also used images from a sky-cam,
along with the manual inspection.


Reasoning for the  final selection...........



## Criteria for enhancement identification




Many have used models or some statistical method to determine then CE thresholds.

....... cite ...... Descriptions

We used as reference a modeled clear sky approximation,

Criteria for cloud enhancement identification are set according the Equation \ref{eq:CE4}

\begin{equation}
\text{CE}_\text{Threshold} = \begin{cases}
`r C4_cs_ref_ratio`, & \text{$\theta \leq `r C4_lowcut_sza`^\circ$}\\
\frac{`r C4_cs_ref_ratio` - `r C4_lowcut_ratio`}{`r C4_lowcut_sza` - `r 90 - BIO_ELEVA`} \cdot (\theta- `r 90 - BIO_ELEVA`) + `r C4_lowcut_ratio` , & \text{$ `r 90 - BIO_ELEVA`^\circ > \theta > `r C4_lowcut_sza`^\circ$}\\
\text{Excluded measurements}, & \theta > `r 90 - BIO_ELEVA`^\circ
\end{cases}\label{eq:CE4}
\end{equation}
where: $\theta$ solar zenith angle.





A secondary criteria was used for extreme cloud enhancement cases (ECE) identification, relative to the TSI at horizontal plane (Equation \ref{eq:ECE})

\begin{equation}
\text{GHI} > \cos(\theta) \times \text{TSI}_\text{TOA}
\label{eq:ECE}
\end{equation}
