  abstract         = {A methodology for the absolute calibration of spectral measurements of direct solar ultraviolet radiation, performed with a Brewer spectrophotometer is presented. The method uses absolute measurements of global and diffuse solar irradiance obtained practically simultaneously at each wavelength with the direct-Sun component. On the basis of this calibration, direct-Sun spectra, measured over a wide range of solar zenith angles at a high altitude site, were used to determine the extraterrestrial solar spectrum by applying the Langley extrapolation method. Finally this spectrum is compared with a solar spectrum derived from the airborne tunable laser absorption spectrometer 3 Space Shuttle mission, showing an agreement of better than Ϯ3%.},

Linear trends have been calculated for the entire dataset, for cloud-free cases, and for different SZAs, separately for each season. The global upward trend in SDR after 1990 (0.33%year-1) is reconfirmed and is found to depend strongly on SZA, ranging from ∼0.1 to +0.6%year-1. The long term changes in aerosols in conjunction with the local aerosol patterns result in differences of up to 0.1%year-1 in the derived trends in SDR between morning and afternoon hours. Finally, based on the analysis of the cumulative sums of the differences in monthly averages of SDR from the long term mean we report signs of a slowdown in the upward trend in SDR during the beginning of the 2000s. textcopyright2012 Royal Meteorological Society.},

  abstract         = {The slope and aspect of a vegetated surface strongly affects the amount of solar radiation intercepted by that surface. Solar radiation is the dominant component of the surface energy balance and inﬂuences ecologically critical factors of microclimate, including nearsurface temperatures, evaporative demand and soil moisture content. It also determines the exposure of vegetation to photosynthetically active and ultra-violet wavelengths. Spatial variation in slope and aspect is therefore a key determinant of vegetation pattern, species distribution and ecosystem processes in many environments. Slope and aspect angle may vary considerably over distances of a few metres, and ﬁne-scale species’ distribution patterns frequently follow these topographic patterns. The availability of suitable microclimate at such scales may be critical for the response of species distributions to climatic change at much larger spatial scales. However, quantifying the relevant microclimatic gradients is not straightforward, as the potential variation in solar radiation ﬂux under clear-sky conditions is modiﬁed by local and regional variations in cloud cover, and interacts with long-wave radiation exchange, local meteorology and surface characteristics.},

  abstract         = {Most investigations on the nature and effects of solar ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation at the Earth's surface require measurements of high accuracy combined with well-defined procedures to assess their quality. Here we present a general evaluation of all relevant errors and uncertainties associated with measurements of spectral global irradiance in the {UV}. The uncertainties are quantified in terms of dependence of the characteristics of the spectroradiometer, the uncertainty of calibration standards, the solar zenith angle, and atmospheric conditions. The methodologies and equations presented can be applied to most spectroradiometers currently employed for {UV} research. The sources of error addressed include ra- diometric calibration, cosine error, spectral resolution, wavelength misalignment, stability, noise, stray light, and timing errors. The practical application of the method is demonstrated by setting up a complete uncertainty table for the mobile spectroradiometer of the Fraunhofer Institute for Atmospheric Environmental Re- search ({IFU}). This instrument has successfully participated in several international intercomparisons of {UV} spectroradiometers. The expanded uncertainty (coverage factor k - 2) for measurements of global spectral irradiance conducted with this in- strument varies between 6.3\% in the {UVA} and 12.7\% at 300 nm and 60 ø solar zenith angle. The expanded uncertainties in erythemally and {DNA} weighted irradiances are 6.1\% and 6.6\%, respectively. These expanded uncertainties are comparable to uncertainties at the 2or level in conventional statistics. A substantial reduction of these uncertainties would require smaller uncertainties in the irradiance standards used to calibrate the instrument. Though uncertainties caused by wavelength misalignment and noise become prominent in the shortwave {UVB}, which is the most important spectral range for {UV} trend detection, the results indicate that the accuracy of the {IFU} radiometer is sufficient to detect long-term trends in {UV} arising from a 3\% change in atmospheric ozone. The detection of trends caused by a 1\% change in ozone may be beyond the capabilities of current instrumentation},

These measurements were recorded during a measurement campaign between May and October 2012, aimed at studying the influence of atmospheric compounds on solar radiation transfer through the atmosphere. The effects of TOC, AOD and w on UVER and SW (global, diffuse and direct) irradiance were quantified using irradiance values under cloud-free conditions at different fixed solar zenith angles (SZA). Results show that UVER (but not SW) irradiance correlates well with TOC. UVER variations ranged between-0.24%DU-1 and-0.32%DU-1 with all changes being statistically significant. Global SW irradiance varies with water vapour column between-2.44%cm-1 and-4.53%cm-1, these results proving statistically significant and diminishing when SZA increases. The irradiance variations range between 42.15%cm-1 and 20.30%cm-1 for diffuse SW when SZA varies between 20° and 70°. The effect of aerosols on global UVER is stronger than on global SW. Aerosols cause a UVER reduction of between 28.12% and 52.41% and a global SW reduction between 13.46% and 41.41% per AOD550 unit. Empirical results show that solar position plays a determinant role, that there is a negligible effect of ozone on SW radiation, and stronger attenuation by aerosol particles in UVER radiation.},

To do this, a parametric clear sky solar irradiance model has been built and validated. For applying the model, a set of four meteorological parameters (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, water vapor column content and the ngström turbidity coefficient) are required at input. The energy loss in a pollution episode was evaluated as the difference between the clear sky solar irradiation computed in two situations: (1) Using measured values for all inputs and (2) using measured values for all inputs excepting the ngström turbidity coefficient, for which a climatological reference value has been assumed. The calculations show that the aerosol pollution can lead to a significant loss of collectable solar energy, of over 20%. Overall results drive to the generic conclusion that the pollution episodes should be considered in both stages of a photovoltaic plant: in development, by taking them into account when the typical meteorological year is constructed, and in the exploiting stage, by accounting them in the forecasting procedure of the output power.

  abstract         = {The determination of aerosol properties, especially the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the UV wavelength region is of great importance to understand the climatological variability of UV radiation. However, operational retrievals of AOD at the biological most harmful wavelengths in the UVB are currently only made at very few places. This paper reports on the UVPFR sunphotometer, a stable and robust instrument that can be used for AOD retrievals at four UV wavelengths. Instrument characteristics and results of Langley calibrations at a high altitude site were presented. It was shown that due to the relatively wide spectral response functions of the UVPFR, the calibration constants (Vtextbackslashtextsubscript0) from Langley plot calibrations underestimate the true extra-terrestrial signals. Accordingly, correction factors were introduced. In addition, the instrument spectral response functions also result in an apparent airmass dependent decrease in ozone optical depth used in the AOD determinations. An adjusted formula for the calculation of AOD, with a correction term dependent on total column ozone amount and ozone air mass, was therefore developed. Langley calibrations performed 13–14 months apart resulted in sensitivity changes of $textbackslashleq$textbackslashhspace0.167em1.1textbackslashhspace0.167em indicating good instrument stability. Comparison with a standard PFR, measuring AOD at 368–862textbackslashhspace0.167emnm wavelengths with high accuracy, showed consistent results. Also very good agreement was achieved comparing the UVPFR with AOD at UVB wavelengths derived with a Brewer spectrophotometer, which was calibrated against the UVPFR at an earlier date. Mainly due to non-instrumental uncertainties connected with ozone optical depth, the total uncertainty of AOD in the UVB are higher than the ones reported from UVA and visible AOD measuring instruments. However, the precision can be high between instruments using harmonized algorithms for ozone and Rayleigh optical depth as well as for air mass terms. For several months of comparison measurements with the UVPFR and a Brewer the root mean squared AOD differences were},

  abstract         = {Cloud enhancement events are instances in which the cloud pattern increases global horizontal irradiance on the ground above levels higher than would otherwise be expected during clear sky with cloudless conditions, and in general, these events are characterized by high irradiances occurring during highly changing transient condi­ tions. Even though it is a well-known although infrequent phenomenon, currently no consensus exists as to its formal definition. However, several studies point out to a need for a better understanding of this phenomenon due to their effects on mathematical models or photovoltaic systems behavior during these instances, as results show significant deviations with respect to the expected results in normal conditions. Due to these issues, the present work intends to explore cloud enhancement definitions and detection methods, for which a novel modelindependent, statistically-driven approach is proposed and compared to three other models found in the liter­ ature. Assessments are made regarding the main aspects of the phenomenon: frequency of occurrence, clearness index, diffuse fraction and its relationship with solar resource variability. Data from eight measurements sites throughout Chile, with different climatic characteristics is used. To further support the analysis made, monthly maximum expected clear sky irradiance for each site was estimated through satellite-based data as well as with estimation from ground measurements. Finally, the highest irradiances are presented for each measurement site reporting, the record irradiances for one-minute data thermopile and photodiode pyranometers.},

We have used the Langley Plot Method (LPM) to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from these observations over a long time period: from 1984 to November 2002. A seasonal variation of the AOD is clearly observed with mean AOD values of about 0.4 and 0.9 at 306.3 nm in winter and in summer respectively. The magnitude of these AODs is comparable to the AODs measured by AERONET sunphotometers at other places. We succeeded to demonstrate the impact of the eruption of Mount Pinatubo on the retrieved AOD in the UV-B at Uccle in winter. Trend analysis on the mean annual AOD gives significant negative trends at the 2s level only from 1989 to 2002 at all wavelengths and not over the whole period 1984–2002. The annual trend amounts to 2.46 ± 0.37year at 306.3 nm over 1989–2002. Significant negative seasonal trends at the 2s level are only found in winter at all wavelengths (2.66 ± 0.65year at 306.3 nm for example) and in summer at 306.3 nm (1.24 ± 0.55year). In summer, in autumn and in spring at the other 4 wavelengths the trends are not significant at the 2s level.},

The comparison between AODs from Brewer spectrophotometer 128 at 320.1 nm and sunphotometer SPM2000 at 368 nm at Norrköping shows that the AODs obtained from the Brewer measurements with the Langley Plot Method (LPM) are very accurate if the neutral density filter spectral transmittances are well known: with the measured values of these filters, the correlation coefficient, the slope, and the intercept of the regression line are 0.98, 0.85 ± 0.004, and 0.02 ± 0.0014, respectively. The bias observed is mainly owing to the wavelength difference between the two instruments. The comparison between AODs from different Brewer spectrophotometers confirm that AODs will be in very good agreement if they are measured with several Brewer instruments at the same place: At Uccle, the correlation coefficient, slope, and intercept of the regression line are 0.98, 1.02 ± 0.003, and 0.06 ± 0.001, respectively; at Arosa, the comparisons between the AODs from three Brewer spectrophotometers 040, 072, and 156 give a correlation coefficient, a slope, and an intercept of the regression line above 0.94, 0.98 and below 0.04, respectively.

Climate-driving variables like the surface solar radiation ( S  {SR} )  are shown to exhibit unforced trends ( i .e., trends due to internal variability )  of magnitudes comparable to the magnitude of the forced signal even on decadal timescales. We use annual mean data from 50 models participating in the preindustrial control experiment ( p  {iControl} )  of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 6 ( C  {MIP}6 )  to give quantitative grid-box specific estimates of the magnitudes of unforced trends. To characterize a trend distribution, symmetrical around 0, we use the 75th percentile of all possible values, which corresponds to a positive trend with 25\% chance of occurrence. For 30-year periods and depending on geographical location, this trend has a magnitude between 0.15 and 2.1 W m −2/decade for all-sky and between 0.04 and 0.38 W m −2/decade for clear-sky {SSR}. The corresponding area-weighted medians are 0.69 W m −2/decade for all-sky trends and 0.17 W m −2/decade for clear-sky trends. The influence of internal variability is on average six times smaller in clear-sky, compared to all-sky {SSR}. The relative uncertainties in the physical representation, derived from the {CMIP}6 inter-model spread, are ±32\% for all-sky and ±43\% for clear-sky {SSR} trends. Reasons for differences between models like horizontal resolution, aerosol handling, and the representation of atmospheric and oceanic phenomena are investigated. The results can be used in the analysis of observational time series by attributing a probability for a trend to be caused by internal variability, given its magnitude, length, and location.},

The quality data control has revealed the necessity of their additional cloud and NO2 correction. The application of cloud correction according to hourly visual cloud observations provides a decrease in average aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 500 nm of up to 0.03 compared with the standard dataset. We also show that the additional NO2 correction of the AERONET data is needed in large megalopolis, like Moscow, with 12 million residents and the NOx emission rates of about 100 kt yr-1. According to the developed method we estimated monthly mean NO2 content, which provides an additional decrease of 0.01 for AOT at 340 nm, and of about 0.015 -- for AOT at 380 and 440 nm. The ratios of NO2 optical thickness to AOT at 380 and 440 nm are about 5--6 % in summer and reach 15--20 % in winter when both factors have similar effects on UV irradiance. Seasonal cycle of AOT at 500 nm is characterized by a noticeable summer and spring maxima, and minimum in winter conditions, changing from 0.08 in December and January up to 0.3 in August. The application of the additional cloud correction removes a local AOT maximum in February, and lowered the December artificial high AOT values. The pronounced negative AOT trends of about -1--5 % yr-1 have been obtained for most months, which could be attributed to the negative trends in emissions (E) of different aerosol precursors of about 116 Gg yr-2 in ESOx, 78 Gg yr-2 in ENMVOC, and 272 Gg yr-2 in ECO over European territory of Russia. No influence of natural factors on temporal AOT variations has been revealed.},

  abstract         = {Time series of clear-sky irradiance are fundamental for the understanding of changes in the Earth Radiation budget, since they allow to examine radiative processes in the cloud-free atmosphere. Clear-sky data is usually derived from all-sky irradiances using one of several clear-sky methods proposed in the literature. However, most of the available clear-sky methods require additional in situ measurements and/or high temporal resolution (sub-daily), which restricts the derivation of clear-sky time series to a few well equipped stations. Here we propose a new clear-sky identification method that aims to overcome this problem, with the ultimate goal of deriving multidecadal clear-sky trends for many sites globally. The method uses site specific monthly transmittance thresholds to derive long term clear-sky time series for any station worldwide that has daily mean irradiance data. We exemplify the method for 24 stations. Transmittance thresholds are derived by combining 29 years (1990–2018) of satellite cloud cover data with in situ irradiance measurements. The thresholds are then applied to the whole time series (independent of satellite data availability) to screen out cloudy days. Comparison of our results with reference data derived using Long and Ackerman's (2000, https://doi. org/10.1029/2000jd900077) method shows good agreement after bias correction, especially for decadal trends. While limitations of the method, such as anomalies representation, are highlighted and discussed, validation results encourage its use to derive long term clear-sky time series and associated decadal-scale trends around the globe.},

Best Estimate Flux data span a 13 year timeframe at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program’s Southern Great Plains (SGP) site. Screened clear-sky irradiances and aerosol optical depth (AOD), for solar zenith angles ≤ 65°, are used to estimate clear-sky diffuse irradiances. We validate against detected clear-sky observations from SGP’s Basic Radiation System (BRS). BRS diffuse irradiances were in accordance with estimates, producing a root-mean-square error and mean bias errors of 4.0 W/m2 and À1.4 W/m2, respectively. Absolute differences show 99% of estimates within ±10 W/m2 (10 of the mean BRS observations. Clear-sky diffuse estimates are used to derive quantitative estimates of aerosol radiative effects, represented as the aerosol diffuse irradiance (ADI). ADI is the contribution of diffuse SW to global SW, attributable to scattering of atmospheric transmission by natural plus anthropogenic aerosols. Estimated slope for the ADI as a function of AOD indicates an increase of textasciitilde22 W/m2 in diffuse SW for every 0.1 increase in AOD. Such signiﬁcant increases in the diffuse fraction could possibly increase photosynthesis. Annual mean ADI is 28.2 W/m2, and heavy aerosol loading at SGP provides up to a maximum increase of 120 W/m2 in diffuse SW over background conditions. With regard to seasonal variation, the mean diffuse forcings are 17.2, 33.3, 39.0, and 23.6 W/m2 for winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively.},

  abstract         = {The objective of this work is to verify the attenuation caused by atmospheric constituents through the relationship between global, direct and diffuse solar radiation with respect to optical air mass. The optical air mass change has spatial and temporal dependence and influences the radiation flux incident, causing changes in the average values. Global, diffuse and direct solar irradiances were provided by the Laboratory of Solar Radiometry of BotucatuUNESP (latitude 22.9º South, longitude 48.45º West, altitude 745 m). The period assigned for the study comprised the years 2002 to 2006. The global solar radiation was measured by an Eppley PSP pyranometer. The direct solar radiation was measured by an Eppley Nip pyrheliometer attached to a ST-3 solar tracking system. The diffuse solar radiation was calculated by the difference between global and direct solar radiations. It was observed a decrease of solar radiation with the increase of optical air mass justified by the increase in probability of collision of solar rays with atmospheric constituents. For global solar radiation and optical air mass mo = 1, it was observed a minimum at 3.1 MJ/m2 and a maximum of 4.1 MJ/m2. For optical air mass mo=2, minimum at 1.5 MJ/m2 and a maximum of 1.9 MJ/m2. For direct solar radiation and optical air mass mo = 1, it was observed a minimum at 2 MJ/m2 and a maximum of 3.8 MJ/m2. For optical air mass mo=2, minimum at 1 MJ/m2 and a maximum of 1.5 MJ/m2. For diffuse solar radiation and optical air mass mo = 1, it was observed a minimum at 0.1 MJ/m2 and a maximum of 1.5 MJ/m2. For optical air mass mo=2, minimum at 0.1 MJ/m2 and a maximum of 0.8 MJ/m2. The joint analysis of data from direct and diffuse solar radiation allowed better understand of the attenuation process caused by the atmosphere, establishing qualitative relationships between absorption, scattering and reflection processes.},

Algorithm development is focused on improving aerosol retrievals by means of including a detailed statistical optimization of the influence of noise in the inversion procedure. The methodological aspects of such an optimization are discussed in detail and revised according to both modern findings in inversion theory and practical experience in remote sensing. Accordingly, the proposed inversion algorithm is built on the principles of statistical estimation: the spectral radiances and various a priori constraints on aerosol characteristics are considered as multisource data that are known with predetermined accuracy. The inversion is designed as a search for the best fit of all input data by a theoretical model that takes into account the different llevels of accuracy of the fitted data. The algorithm allows a choice of normal or lognormal noise assumptions. The multivariable fitting is implemented by a stable numerical procedure combining matrix inversion and univariant relaxation. The theoretical inversion scheme has been realized in the advanced algorithm retrieving aerosol size distribution together with complex refractive index from the spectral measurements of direct and diffuse radiation. The aerosol particles are modeled as homogeneous spheres. The atmospheric radiative transfer modeling is implemented with well-established publicly available radiative transfer codes. The retrieved refractive indices can be wavelength dependent; however, the extended smoothness constraints are applied to its spectral dependence (and indirectly through smoothness constraints on retrieved size distributions). The positive effects of statistical optimization on the retrieval results as well as the importance of applying a priori constraints are discussed in detail for the retrieval of both aerosol size distribution and complex refractive index. The developed algorithm is adapted for the retrieval of aerosol properties from measurements made by ground-based Sun-sky scanning radiometers used in the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). The results of numerical tests together with examples of experimental data inversions are presented.},

The monthly averages of daily values for these meteorological variables have been calculated. The data are then divided into two sets. The sub-data set I (1996–2004) are employed to develop empirical correlations between the monthly average of daily global solar radiation fraction (H/H0) and the various weather parameters. The sub-data set II (2005–2007) are then used to evaluate the derived correlations. Furthermore, the total solar radiation on horizontal surfaces is separated into the beam and diffuses components. Empirical correlations for estimating the diffuse solar radiation incident on horizontal surfaces have been proposed. The total solar radiation incident on a tilted surface facing south Ht with different tilt angles is then calculated using both Liu and Jordan isotropic model and Klucher’s anisotropic model. It is inferred that the isotropic model is able to estimate Ht more accurate than the anisotropic one. At the optimum tilt angle, the maximum value of Ht is obtained as $36 (MJ/m2 day) during January. Comparisons with 22 years average data of NASA SSE Model showed that the proposed correlations are able to predict the total annual energy on horizontal and tilted surfaces in Jeddah with a reasonable accuracy. It is also found that at Jeddah, the solar energy devices have to be tilted to face south with a tilt angle equals the latitude of the place in order to achieve the best performance all year round.},

Clear sky models are essential for estimating the generation potential of various solar energy technologies, the basic calibration of radiation measuring equipment, quality control of solar radiation datasets, engineering design (e.g. heating and cooling of buildings) and in agricultural and biological sciences (e.g. forestry). All of these areas are of considerable interest to the Australian economy and will benefit from an assessment of clear sky radiation models. With the recent provision of one-minute interval radiation data by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology for 20 sites across Australia, such a study can now be undertaken at a level not previously possible. Using up to ten years of data from each of 14 of these sites, clear sky periods are extracted through an automated detection algorithm. With these clear sky periods identified, nine of the most prominent beam and global clear sky radiation models are assessed using the relative Mean Bias Error, relative Root Mean Square Error and Coefficient of Determination as metrics. Further testing assessed model performance as a function of solar zenith angle and apparent solar time. Results show that for global clear sky simulations, the Solis, Esra and REST2 approaches perform best, while the Iqbal, Esra and REST2 methods are the most proficient clear sky beam models.},

Five characteristics of the difference with satellite data were calculated for each site and instrument type: the mean difference, the standard deviation of daily differences, the standard deviation of monthly differences, the amplitude of the seasonal component of the difference, and the range of annual values. All these characteristics were calculated for five 5-year-long bins and for each site separately for direct sun (DS) and zenith sky (ZS) ozone measurements. The main percentiles were estimated for the five characteristics of the difference and then used to establish criteria for ‘‘suspect” or ‘‘outlier” sites for each characteristic. About 61% of Dobson, 46% of Brewer, and 28% of filter stations located between 60?S and 60?N have no ‘‘suspect” or ‘‘outlier” characteristics. In nearly 90% of all cases, Dobson and Brewer sites demonstrated 5-year mean differences with satellites to be within ±3% (for DS observations). The seasonal median difference between all Brewer DS measurements at 25?–60?N and GOME and OMI overpasses remained within ±0.5% over a period of more than 10 years. The satellite instrument performance was also analyzed to determine typical measurement uncertainties. It is demonstrated that systematic differences between the analyzed satellite instruments are typically within ±2% and very rarely are they outside the ±3% envelope. As the satellite instrument measurements appear to be better than ±3 ground-based instruments with precision values worse than ±3% are not particularly useful for the analyses of long-term changes and comparison with numerical simulations.},

In this study we use the newest collection (C006) of aerosol optical depth from MODIS-Aqua, from which we also derived the fine-mode fraction and Ångström exponent over the last 12 years (i.e., from 2002 to 2014), providing the longest analyzed dataset for this region. The long-term regional optical depth average is 0.20 ± 0.05, with the indicated uncertainty reflecting the inter-annual variability. Overall, the aerosol optical depth exhibits a south-to-north decreasing gradient and an average decreasing trend of 0.0030 per year (19% total decrease over the study period). The correlation between the reported AOD observations with measurements from the ground AERONET stations is high (= 0.76-0.80 depending on the wavelength), with the MODIS-Aqua data being slightly overestimated. Both fine-fraction and Ångström exponent data highlight the dominance of anthropogenic aerosols over the northern, and of desert aerosols over the southern part of the region. Clear intrusions of desert dust over the Eastern Mediterranean are observed principally in spring, and in some cases in winter. Dust intrusions dominate the Western Mediterranean in the summer (and sometimes in autumn), whereas anthropogenic aerosols dominate the sub-region of the Black Sea in all seasons but especially during summer. Fine-mode optical depth is found to decrease over almost all areas of the study region during the 12-year period, marking the decreasing contribution of anthropogenic particulate matter emissions over the study area. Coarse-mode aerosol load also exhibits an overall decreasing trend. However, its decrease is smaller than that of fine aerosols and not as uniformly distributed, underlining that the overall decrease in the region arises mainly from reduced anthropogenic emissions.},

  abstract         = {This paper presents two new modeling components based on the object modeling system v3 (OMS3) for the calculation of the shortwave incident radiation (Rsw darr;) on complex topography settings, and the implementation of several ancillary tools. The first component, NewAGE-SwRB, accounts for elevation slope, aspect, shadow of the sites, and uses suitable parameterization for obtaining the cloudless irradiance. A second component, NewAGE-DEC-MODś is implemented to estimate the irradiance reduction due to the presence of clouds according to three parameterizations. To obtain a working modeling composition that is comparable with ground data at measurement stations the two components are connected to a kriging component. With the help of an additional component, NewAGE-V (verification package), the performance of modeled (Rsw darr;) is quantitatively evaluated. The two components (and the various parameterizations they contain) are tested using the data from three basins, and some simple verification tests were carried out to assess the goodness of the methods used. Moreover, a raster mode test is performed in order to show the capability of the system in providing solar radiation raster maps. The components are part of a larger system, JGrass-NewAGE, their input and outputs are geometrical objects immediately displayed in a geographical information system (GIS). They can be used seamlessly with the various modeling solutions available in JGrass-NewAGE for the estimation of long wave radiation, evapotranspiration, and snow melting, as well as standalone components to just estimate shortwave radiation for various uses. The modularity of the approach leads to more accurate physical-statistical studies aimed to assess in depth the components ́performances and extends their results spatially, without the necessity of recoding any part of the component. textcopyright 2013 Author(s).

  abstract         = {Ground-based radiation measurements are required for all large solar projects and for evaluating the accuracy of solar radiation models and datasets. Ground data almost always contain low-quality periods caused by instrumental issues, logging errors, or maintenance deficiencies. Therefore, quality control ({QC}) is needed to detect and eventually flag or exclude such suspicious or erroneous data before any subsequent analysis. The few existing automatic {QC} methods are not perfect, thus expert visual inspection of the data is still required. In this work, we present a harmonized {QC} procedure, which is a combination of various available methods, including some that include an expert visual inspection. In the framework of {IEA} {PVPS} Task 16, these tests are applied to 161 world stations that are equipped with various radiometer models, and are candidates for an ongoing benchmark of irradiance datasets derived from satellite or weather models. Because the implementation of these methods by experts, and their subsequent decisions, might lead to different {QC} results, the independently obtained results from nine evaluators are compared for two test sites. The {QC} results are found similar and more stringent than purely automated tests, even though some deviations exist due to differences in manual flagging.},

  abstract         = {The gap in knowledge regarding the radiative effects of aerosols in the UV region of the solar spectrum is large, mainly due to the lack of systematic measurements of the aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) and absorption optical depth (AAOD). In the present study, spectral UV measurements performed in Thessaloniki, Greece by a double monochromator Brewer spectrophotometer in the period 1998--2017 are used for the calculation of the aforementioned optical properties. The main uncertainty factors have been described and there is an effort to quantify the overall uncertainties in SSA and AAOD. Analysis of the results suggests that the absorption by aerosols is much stronger in the UV relative to the visible. SSA follows a clear annual pattern ranging from $\sim$0.7 in winter to $\sim$0.85 in summer at wavelengths 320--360 nm, while AAOD peaks in summer and winter. The average AAOD for 2009--2011 is $\sim$50% above the 2003--2006 average, possibly due to increased emissions of absorbing aerosols related to the economic crisis and the metro-railway construction works in the city center.},

  abstract         = {<p>Brewer spectrophotometers are widely used instruments which perform spectral measurements of the direct and the global solar UV irradiance. By processing these measurements a variety of secondary products can be derived such as the total columns of ozone, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, and aerosol optical properties. Estimating and limiting the uncertainties of the final products is of critical importance. High quality data have a lot of applications and can provide accurate estimations of trends. The dead time is characteristic for each instrument and non-proper correction of the raw data for its effect may lead to important errors in the final products. It may change with time and the currently used methodology is not always sufficient to accurately determine the correct dead time. For specific cases, such as for low ozone slant columns and high intensities of the direct solar irradiance, the error in the retrieved TOC, due a 10 ns change in the dead time from its nominal value, is found to be up to 5 %. The error in the calculation of UV irradiance is about 3â•ﬁ4 % near the maximum operational limit of light intensities. While in the existing documentation it is indicated that the dead time effects are important when the error in the used value is greater than 2 ns, we found that for single monochromator Brewers a 2 ns error in the dead time may lead to uncertainties above the limit of 1 % in the calculation of TOC; thus the tolerance limit should be lowered. A new routine for the determination of the dead time from direct solar irradiance measurements has been created and tested and a validation of the operational algorithm has been performed. Additionally, new methods for the estimation and the validation of the dead time have been developed and are analytically described. Therefore, the present study in addition to highlighting the importance of the dead time for the processing of Brewer datasets, also provide useful information for their quality control and re-evaluation.</p>},

The growing scientific interest in atmospheric aerosol particles is due to their high importance for environmental policy. In fact, particulate matter constitutes one of the most challenging problems both for air quality and for climate change policies.

The synthesis reveals many new processes and developments in the science underpinning climateâ•ﬁaerosol interactions and effects of PM on human health and the environment. However, while airborne particulate matter is responsible for globally important influences on premature human mortality, we still do not know the relative importance of the different chemical components of PM for these effects. Likewise, the magnitude of the overall effects of PM on climate remains highly uncertain. Despite the uncertainty there are many things that could be done to mitigate local and global problems of atmospheric PM. Recent analyses have shown that reducing black carbon (BC) emissions, using known control measures, would reduce global warming and delay the time when anthropogenic effects on global temperature would exceed 2 Â°C. Likewise, cost-effective control measures on ammonia, an important agricultural precursor gas for secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA), would reduce regional eutrophication and PM concentrations in large areas of Europe, China and the USA. Thus, there is much that could be done to reduce the effects of atmospheric PM on the climate and the health of the environment and the human population. A prioritized list of actions to mitigate the full range of effects of PM is currently undeliverable due to shortcomings in the knowledge of aerosol science; among the shortcomings, the roles of PM in global climate and the relative roles of different PM precursor sources and their response to climate and land use change over the remaining decades of this century are prominent.

Analysis of the sensitivity of both instruments to variations of their internal temperature revealed that they have temperature coefficients of different sign. These coefficients exhibit small variability during the 15-year period. Using averaged temperature coefficients, we corrected both datasets. Corrections were applied for the angular response error using two different approaches depending on the availability of required ancillary data. The uncertainties associated with the measurements have been estimated and presented. Finally, the two datasets are compared using ratios of irradiance integrals at various bands in the UV, in order to assess any dependencies on the internal instrument temperature, solar zenith angle and wavelength.},

We propose a simple graphical method to visually convert (α, δα) to the contribution of fine aerosol to the AOT and the size of the fine aerosols. This information can be used to track mixtures of pollution aerosol with dust, to distinguish aerosol growth from cloud contamination and to observe aerosol humidification. The graphical method is applied to the analysis of yearly records at 8 sites in 3 continents, characterized by different levels of pollution, biomass burning and mineral dust concentrations. Results depict the dominance of fine mode aerosols in driving the AOT at polluted sites. In stable meteorological conditions, we see an increase in the size of the fine aerosol as the pollution stagnates and increases in optical thickness. Coexistence of coarse and fine particles is evidenced at the polluted sites downwind of arid regions.},

It is shown that the new values of Tt are clearly different from those obtained by Kasten's formula which parameterizes the optical thickness of the clean dry atmosphere. The model is used to investigate the dependence of Tt on the relative optical air mass and to elucidate the relationships linking TL to Angstrrm's turbidity coefficient and to the water vapor content. For any TL, the corresponding value related to the air mass 2.0 can be determined. Such a standardized value is independent of solar elevation and is therefore strictly representative of the atmospheric turbidity. It can be linked to Angstrrm's turbidity coefficient. Practical procedures and algorithms for computing the standard Linke's turbidity factor and determining Angstrrm's turbidity coefficient are described. A relationship for converting the Tt values obtained by Kasten's formula into the new values is proposed},

Two calibration methodologies, one adapted to the ultraviolet (UV) and one adapted to the visible wavelength range, have been developed to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from these measurements. The measurements in the UV were calibrated in absolute units using laboratory lamp calibrations of the global entrance port of the same instrument, while in the visible wavelength range a zero air mass Langley extrapolation methodology was implemented. The retrieved aerosol optical depths were validated with a colocated CIMEL Sun photometer operating within the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) since 1997. AOD values at Ispra show a strong short-term variability between 0.05 and 2 at 320 nm as well as a pronounced seasonal variability. The highest monthly mean values of around 0.6 (at 320 nm) are usually found in spring and summer while the lowest values, of about 0.3, are found in the winter months. An aerosol characterization by means of the  ̊ Angstro ̈m power law yields a mean wavelength exponent of 1.6. The influence of Fo ̈hn events on the aerosol climatology at Ispra was investigated. The AOD measurements at Ispra show the strong influence of the Mount Pinatubo eruption in June 1991 and the following decay to background levels in late 1997.},

This first part focuses on global horizontal irradiance. Various possible definitions of the CE phenomenon are extracted from the literature and discussed, in the context of PV applications most importantly. Based on 10 years of 1-min measurements of all shortwave irradiance components at a high-elevation site (1829 m) on the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, a frequency analysis of extreme events triggered by enhancement effects is carried out, using three different criteria to delineate enhancement effects: global horizontal irradiance (GHI) above 1 sun, and clearness index (KT) above either 0.8 or 1.0. This analysis shows that the annual frequency of these extreme events is extremely variable, and also largely dependent on the type of instrumentation (thermopile vs. photodiode). Although the scattering of light off cumulus-type cloud edges is directly associated with CE effects, three different types of CE phenomenon are proposed, which depend on the relative mix of diffuse and direct irradiance prior and during an episode, and on the magnitude of the regional albedo. The maximum observed global irradiance varies between 1546 and 1891 W m−2 at this site, depending on type of instrument and temporal resolution. The latter value (≈1.9 suns), obtained with a photodiode sensor at 1-s resolution, corresponds to KT = 1.62 and appears to constitute a new GHI world record. It results from the combination of CE and AE effects, the latter being caused by strong backscattering, itself triggered by a fresh snow cover over the region. If the magnitude and frequency of enhancement events are critical to detect rapid transients that can be harmful to PV installations, it is suggested to rely on photodiode sensors at 1-s resolution or better.},

  abstract         = {A reevaluation of the solar constant is undertaken here to take into account the progress in space radiometry that has occurred since the early 2000s. Various sources of spaceborne total solar irradiance ({TSI}) observations are investigated here, including the long-term {ACRIM} and {PMOD} composites, as well as recent observations from the {SORCE}-{TIM}, {TCTE}-{TIM}, and {PICARD}-{PREMOS} instruments. A proxy model is constructed using daily data of sunspot number, radio ﬂux at 10.7 cm, and {MgII} index, as predictors for {TSI} over the 42-year period 1976–2017. These daily estimates are used to ﬁll in 9.7\% of missing {TSI} observations during that period. By comparison with these proxy estimates, the {PMOD} composite appears generally more reliable than the {ACRIM} composite before 2003, and particularly before 1981. The 42-year time span is separated into nine periods, each deﬁning the revised {TSI} daily values from one or more sources that are selected based on the trend of their resemblance with the proxy model. A ﬁnal correction is added to emulate the highly accurate absolute calibration of {PREMOS}. Based on the resulting {TSI} reconstruction, a revised solar constant value of 1361.1 W/m2 is obtained, with a standard uncertainty of 0.5 W/m2. The revised solar constant is ≈5 W/m2 less than the previous values promulgated in {ASTM} and {ISO} standards. A revision of these standards is thus highly recommended.},

  abstract         = {This study examines all known methods that have been proposed in the literature to identify clear-sky periods in historical solar irradiance time series. Two different types of clear-sky detection (CSD) methods are discussed: those (16 total) that attempt to isolate periods of 1-min or more cloudless conditions, and those (5 total) that only attempt to detect clear-sun periods. All methods are found to rely on a diversity of inputs and on a variety of tests that typically examine the smoothness of the temporal variation of global and/or direct irradiance. Using samples of a few days with variable cloudiness, it is shown that these methods all have obvious strengths and weaknesses. Although this justifies a detailed validation to determine which method(s) could be best suited in the practice of solar radiation modeling or other applications, the current lack of appropriate equipment at high- quality reference radiometric stations prevents such an endeavor. Only a preliminary study is conducted here at seven stations of the SURFRAD network in the U.S., where 1-min irradiance measurements are available, along with sky data from a Total Sky Imager (TSI). The many limitations of the latter prevent its data to be considered “ground truth” here. Nevertheless, the comparison of the results from all CSD methods and 1.2 million TSI observations from all SURFRAD sites provides important qualitative and quantitative information, using a variety of performance indicators. Overall, two CSD methods appear more robust and are recommended, pending better high-resolution and high-performance cloud observations from modern sky cameras to redo these tests.},

First, a detailed analysis of the main equations of the models is performed. It is shown that atmospheric effects are not always correctly modeled. The modeling of water vapor absorption, and more importantly of aerosol extinction mostly conditions the overall model accuracy. Second, the performance of each model is statistically evaluated by comparison with a benchmark constituted by the predictions of three sophisticated spectral codes. Third, real life performance is evaluated by comparison with a large number of measured data from seven sites around the world, encompassing a wide range of atmospheric conditions. The more physical models are found to be generally of higher accuracy and greater flexibility than empirical models. 1.},

  abstract         = {Computation of components of shortwave (SW) or solar irradiance in the surface-atmospheric system forms the basis of intercomparison between 16 radiative transfer models of varying spectral resolution ranging from line-by-line models to broadband and general circulation models. In order of increasing complexity the components are: direct solar irradiance at the surface, diffuse irradiance at the surface, diffuse upward flux at the surface, and diffuse upward flux at the top of the atmosphere. These components allow computation of the atmospheric absorptance. Four cases are considered from pure molecular atmospheres to atmospheres with aerosols and atmosphere with a simple uniform cloud. The molecular and aerosol cases allow comparison of aerosol forcing calculation among models. A cloud-free case with measured atmospheric and aerosol properties and measured shortwave radiation components provides an absolute basis for evaluating the models. For the aerosol-free and cloud-free dry atmospheres, models agree to within 1% (root mean square deviation as a percentage of mean) in broadband direct solar irradiance at surface; the agreement is relatively poor at 5% for a humid atmosphere. A comparison of atmospheric absorptance, computed from components of SW radiation, shows that agreement among models is understandably much worse at 3% and 10% for dry and humid atmospheres, respectively. Inclusion of aerosols generally makes the agreement among models worse than when no aerosols are present, with some exceptions. Modeled diffuse surface irradiance is higher than measurements for all models for the same model inputs. Inclusion of an optically thick low-cloud in a tropical atmosphere, a stringent test for multiple scattering calculations, produces, in general, better agreement among models for a low solar zenith angle (SZA = 30°) than for a high SZA (75°). All models show about a 30% increase in broadband absorptance for 30° SZA relative to the clear-sky case and almost no enhancement in absorptance for a higher SZA of 75°, possibly due to water vapor line saturation in the atmosphere above the cloud.

However accurate measurements are not a common commodity, especially over longer time spans. To circumvent the lack of ground based measurements, models can be applied to estimate solar irradiance components. A fundamental component is clear sky irradiance. In particular, clear sky irradiance is used as the normalization function in models that convert meteorological satellite images into irradiance, or in models that decompose global irradiance into diffuse/direct fraction. It is therefore important to evaluate and validate clear sky irradiance models.This paper presents the results of a validation of hourly clear sky models spanning up to eight years. The validation relies on high quality measurements at 22 locations in Europe and around the Mediterranean region. Seven models are evaluated. They were selected on the basis of their published performance, their simplicity of use, and/or their computational speed; two different sources of the aerosol load are used as input to the models.The three best models show a low bias and a standard deviation ranging from ±3% to ±5%. The standard deviation of the bias across the 22 locations is of the same order of magnitude. The observed bias patterns can be largely traced to inaccuracies inherent to the sources aerosol optical depth. No particular seasonal effects are noted. A consistent limitation across all selected models, even if their direct irradiance performance can be judged satisfactory based on the standard deviation metric, is that they tend to fall short of observations for a given clear sky global clearness index value.},

  abstract         = {Clouds significantly attenuate ground-level solar irradiance causing substantial reduction in photovoltaic power output capacity. However, partly cloudy skies may lead to temporary enhancement of local Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) above the clear-sky ceiling and, at times, the extraterrestrial irradiance. Such enhancements are referred to here as Cloud Enhancement Events (CEEs). In this work we study these CEEs and assess quantitatively the occurrence of resulting coherent Ramp Rates (RRs). We analyze a full year of ground irradiance data recorded at the University of California, Merced, as well as nearly five months of irradiance data recorded at the University of California, San Diego, and Ewa Beach, Hawaii. Our analysis shows that approximately 4% of all the data points qualify as potential CEEs, which corresponds to nearly 3.5 full-days of such events per year if considered sequentially. The surplus irradiance enhancements range from 18 W m-2 day-1 to 73 W m-2 day-1. The maximum recorded GHI of ∼1400 W m-2 occurred in San Diego on May 25, 2012, which was nearly 43% higher than the modeled clear-sky ceiling. Wavelet decomposition coupled with fluctuation power index analysis shed light on the time-scales on which cloud induced variability and CEEs operate. Results suggest that while cloud-fields tend to induce variability most strongly at the 30 min time-scale, they have the potential to cause CEEs that induce variability on time-scales of several minutes. This analysis clearly demonstrates that CEEs are an indicator for periods of high variability and therefore provide useful information for solar forecasting and integration.},

  abstract         = {Spectrometers are designed to isolate particular wavebands and suppress light from wavelengths outside the band of interest. However, a small amount of undesired light will always enter the detector, not through the designed optical path, but through random scattering from the instrument optical components, housing, and dust particles. Every spectrophotometer has stray light coming from outside the nominal measurement waveband. For Dobson spectrophotometers and single monochromator Brewer spectrophotometers, which are basic instruments in the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ozone and ultraviolet (UV) monitoring network, the error introduced by stray light is substantial when the ozone slant path becomes very large because of high solar zenith angles and a thick ozone layer. These are common conditions during Arctic spring. To study the issue, a long ozone slant path Intercomparison/Calibration campaign for Nordic Brewers and Dobsons was held at Sodankylä 8-24 March 2011 and a follow-up campaign to extend calibrations to shorter ozone slant paths took place at Izaña observatory, Tenerife, between 28 October and 18 November 2011. These campaigns were part of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Intercalibration of Ground-based Spectrometers and Lidars project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), intended to permit the homogenization of ozone data from the European ozone ground-truthing network. During the active intercomparison periods, measurements were taken only when good conditions for sun or moon observations existed. Laboratory measurements using calibration lamps and helium-cadmium (HeCd) lasers were an essential part of both campaigns. The campaigns produced a high-quality database of total ozone and UV measurements and an accurate, up-to-date calibration and characterization of participating Brewers and Dobsons against the European standard instruments from the Regional Dobson Calibration Centre-Europe (RDCC-E) and the Regional Brewer Calibration Centre-Europe (RBCC-E). In the present work we focus on single monochromator Brewers and present a physics-based method to compensate for the stray-light effects in ozone retrieval using laboratory characterizations and radiative transfer modelling. The method was tested with independent data from the campaign.},

The dataset was compared with collocated measurements of a second spectroradiometer (Brewer MKII) and a CIMEL sun-photometer, showing correlations of 0.93 and 0.98, respectively. A seasonal variation of the AOD was observed at Thessaloniki, with AOD values at 340 nm of 0.52 and 0.28 for August and December respectively. Back trajectories of air masses for up to 4 days were used to assess the influence of long-range transport from various regions to the aerosol load over Thessaloniki. It is shown that part of the observed seasonality can be attributed to air masses with high AOD originating from North-Eastern and Eastern directions during summer-time. The analysis of the long-term record (9 years) of AOD showed a downward tendency. A similar decreasing tendency was found in the record of the PM10 aerosol measurements, which are conducted near the surface at 4 air-quality monitoring stations in the area of the city of Thessaloniki.},

A measurement campaign was organized to obtain the radiation at three different sites, during the month of August 1999, using the same methods and instruments, in order to deduce the atmospheric optical thickness in the spectral UV-B range (280-320 nm). The three observation sites were chosen to cover a wide range of measurement conditions; located near the tropical Atlantic Ocean (Natal, 5.8^circS, 35.2^circW), on the Andes mountains (La Paz, 16.5^circS, 68.1^circW), and in the biomass burning area of central Brazil (Campo Grande, 19.2^circS, 54.3^circW). The UV-B measurements were made with a Brewer spectrophotometer at each site. Since the instrument measures atmospheric ozone and SO  2   simultaneously, it is possible, from the total atmospheric optical thickness τ, to deduce the aerosol optical thickness τ  aerosol  . The results have been combined in different ways to compare with satellite data, showing good performance. Time variations as short as about 10 min can be seen. On clear days the time variations are relatively small, as expected. On the other hand, for the biomass burning site, for conditions of mixed air masses (the instrument is not looking directly at plumes) one can see very large variations in τ in relatively short time intervals, for example, for one case, from 3.5 to 7.0 in about 30 min. Absolute values for τ at Natal and La Paz were near 2.0 and at Campo Grande, between 2.5 and 3.0, but with occasional highs of about 4.5. For τ  aerosol  , Natal and La Paz had values between 0.0 and 0.4, whereas Campo Grande had most values near 0.4, with occasional highs near 1.0, 1.2, and 2.2.

This value is significantly lower than the canonical value of 1365.4 ± 1.3 W m −2 established in the 1990s, which energy balance calculations and climate models currently use. Scattered light is a primary cause of the higher irradiance values measured by the earlier generation of solar radiometers in which the precision aperture defining the measured solar beam is located behind a larger, view-limiting aperture. In the TIM, the opposite order of these apertures precludes this spurious signal by limiting the light entering the instrument. We assess the accuracy and stability of irradiance measurements made since 1978 and the implications of instrument uncertainties and instabilities for climate research in comparison with the new TIM data. TIM's lower solar irradiance value is not a change in the Sun's output, whose variations it detects with stability comparable or superior to prior measurements; instead, its significance is in advancing the capability of monitoring solar irradiance variations on climate-relevant time scales and in improving estimates of Earth energy balance, which the Sun initiates.},

Their agreement in the wavelength range of 310--500 nm is within 0.5% 1.1% (for SZA between 20^circ and 70^circ).

By comparing aerosol optical depth derived from Brewer directsun data in both the United Kingdom and Malaysia, two very different locations, it is determined that while most of the existing global Brewer network could contribute to aerosol optical depth data, further analysis, such as calculation of the A˚ ngstro¨ m parameter, would be dependent on latitude and sky conditions.},

  abstract         = {A new fast clear-sky model called McClear was developed to estimate the downwelling shortwave direct and global irradiances received at ground level under clear skies. It is a fully physical model replacing empirical relations or simpler models used before. It exploits the recent results on aerosol properties, and total column content in water vapour and ozone produced by the MACC project (Monitoring At-mosphere Composition and Climate). It accurately repro-duces the irradiance computed by the libRadtran reference radiative transfer model with a computational speed approx-imately 10 5 times greater by adopting the abaci, or look-up table, approach combined with interpolation functions. It is therefore suited for geostationary satellite retrievals or nu-merical weather prediction schemes with many pixels or grid points, respectively. McClear irradiances were compared to 1 min measurements made in clear-sky conditions at several stations within the Baseline Surface Radiation Network in various climates. The bias for global irradiance comprises be-tween −6 and 25 W m −2 . The RMSE ranges from 20 W m −2 (3 % of the mean observed irradiance) to 36 W m −2 (5 %) and the correlation coefficient ranges between 0.95 and 0.99. The bias for the direct irradiance comprises between −48 and +33 W m −2 . The root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 33 W m −2 (5 %) to 64 W m −2 (10 %). The correlation coefficient ranges between 0.84 and 0.98. This work demon-strates the quality of the McClear model combined with MACC products, and indirectly the quality of the aerosol properties modelled by the MACC reanalysis.},

This information, however, is not available for the entire Brazilian territory. However, hourly measurements of global irradiation for more than seven hundred stations over the territory are available. Several mathematical models have been developed over the past few decades aiming to deliver estimations of solar irradiation components when only measurement of global irradiation is available. In order to provide reliable estimates of diffuse and direct radiation in Brazil, the recently presented Boland {eRidleyeLaurent} ({BRL}) model is adjusted to the particular features of Brazilian climate data, developing adjusted {BRL} models on minute and hourly bases. The model is adjusted using global, diffuse and direct solar irradiation measurements at nine stations, which are maintained by {INPE} in the frame of the {SONDA} project. The methodology for processing and analyzing the quality of the data-sets and the procedures to build the adjusted {BRL} model is thoroughly described. The error indicators show that the adjusted {BRL} model performs better or similarly to the original one, for both diffuse and {DNI} estimates calculated for each analyzed Brazilian station. For instance, the original {BRL} model diffuse fraction estimates have {MeAPE} errors ranging from 16\% to 51\%, while the adjusted {BRL} model gives errors from 9\% to 26\%. Regarding the comparison between the minute and hourly adjusted models, it can be concluded that both performed similarly, indicating that the logistic behavior of the original {BRL} model is well suited to make estimates in sub-hourly data sets. Based on the results, the proposed adjusted model can be used to provide reliable estimates of the distribution of direct and diffuse irradiation, and therefore, can help to properly design and reduce the risks associated to solar energy systems.},

  abstract         = {Functional relations are discussed which express absorbing and scattering processes of shortwave radiation in the atmosphere. A simplified model is derived in which only overall intensities (integrated over the spectral band of insolation) are considered. Balance requirements are established which relate “top albedo” to effective absorption in the air and by the ground, both as fractions of extra-atmospheric irradiance. Measurements of diffuse radiation from the sky, in addition to global radiation, are used to specify scattering versus absorption components of aerosol attenuation for clear-sky conditions with known liquid water content and Rayleigh scattering. Data from three continental locations are selected which are representative of clear-sky attenuation over a desert (La Joya, Peru), an open prairie (O’Neill, Nebraska), and an industrialized urban area (Kew, England). The ratio of absorption to scattering shows significant systematic variation, city aerosol being more efficient as absorber, desert aerosol more as a scatterer. Effects are calculated which result from a systematic variation of ( 1 ) surface albedo, (2)liquid water content, (3) aerosol, and (4) cloud cover. Among other results i t is demonstrated how top albedo (measurable nowadays from orbiting or synchronous satellites) will react to changes in surface albedo and aerosol scattering. It is also shown numerically, how cloud effects on global radiation are modified by the existing turbidity conditions in the cloudless air.},

  abstract         = {The increasing severity of droughts/ﬂoods and worsening air quality from increasing aerosols in Asia monsoon regions are the two gravest threats facing over 60\% of the world population living in Asian monsoon regions. These dual threats have fueled a large body of research in the last decade on the roles of aerosols in impacting Asian monsoon weather and climate. This paper provides a comprehensive review of studies on Asian aerosols, monsoons, and their interactions. The Asian monsoon region is a primary source of emissions of diverse species of aerosols from both anthropogenic and natural origins. The distributions of aerosol loading are strongly inﬂuenced by distinct weather and climatic regimes, which are, in turn, modulated by aerosol effects. On a continental scale, aerosols reduce surface insolation and weaken the land-ocean thermal contrast, thus inhibiting the development of monsoons. Locally, aerosol radiative effects alter the thermodynamic stability and convective potential of the lower atmosphere leading to reduced temperatures, increased atmospheric stability, and weakened wind and atmospheric circulations. The atmospheric thermodynamic state, which determines the formation of clouds, convection, and precipitation, may also be altered by aerosols serving as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei. Absorbing aerosols such as black carbon and desert dust in Asian monsoon regions may also induce dynamical feedback processes, leading to a strengthening of the early monsoon and affecting the subsequent evolution of the monsoon. Many mechanisms have been put forth regarding how aerosols modulate the amplitude, frequency, intensity, and phase of different monsoon climate variables. A wide range of theoretical, observational, and modeling ﬁndings on the Asian monsoon, aerosols, and their interactions are synthesized. A new paradigm is proposed on investigating aerosol-monsoon interactions, in which natural aerosols such as desert dust, black carbon from biomass burning, and biogenic aerosols from vegetation are considered integral components of an intrinsic aerosol-monsoon climate system, subject to external forcing of global warming, anthropogenic aerosols, and land use and change. Future research on aerosol-monsoon interactions calls for an integrated approach and international collaborations based on long-term sustained observations, process measurements, and improved models, as well as using observations to constrain model simulations and projections.},

The current Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol estimation algorithm over land is based on the "dark-object" approach, which works only over densely vegetated ("dark") surfaces. In this study, we develop a new aerosol estimation algorithm that uses the temporal signatures from a sequence of MODIS imagery over land surfaces, particularly "bright" surfaces. The estimated aerosol optical depth is validated by Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements. Case studies indicate that this algorithm can retrieve aerosol optical depths reasonably well from the winter MODIS imagery at seven sites: four sites in the greater Washington, DC area, USA; Beijing City, China; Banizoumbou, Niger, Africa; and Bratts Lake, Canada. The MODIS aerosol estimation algorithm over land (MOD04), however, does not perform well over these non-vegetated surfaces. This new algorithm has the potential to be used for other satellite images that have similar temporal resolutions. textcopyright 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The clear-sky detection method is verified using Whole Sky Imager and lidar data, observer reports, and model comparisons. Identified clear-sky irradiance measurements are then used to empirically fit clear-sky irradiance functions using the cosine of the solar zenith angle as the independent variable. These fitted functions produce continuous estimates of clear-sky total, diffuse, and direct component shortwave irradiances. While this method ignores diurnal changes in such variables as column water vapor and aerosol amounts and changes between clear-sky days, it is shown that the resultant clear-sky irradiance estimates have RMS uncertainty comparable to the uncertainty of the measuring instruments themselves. The estimated clear-sky irradiances are used to estimate the effect of clouds on the downwelling shortwave irradiance as a difference between the measured and clear-sky amounts. We show that the cloud effect calculations from this method appear to decrease the uncertainty due to systematic pyranometer offsets and cosine response errors. Thus any data set that includes downwelling diffuse and total shortwave measurements can be processed to identify clear-sky periods and produce estimates of clear-sky irradiance and cloud effects.},

Comparison between our estimations and clear-sky LW measurements for many years of data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facilityś Southern Great Plains (SGP), TropicalWestern Pacific (TWP), and North Slope of Alaska (NSA) sites show agreement at about the 4 W m?2 level, with 75 94 and 68% of the data falling within that range for the SGP, TWP, and NSA sites, respectively. Although there is no exact means of determining the uncertainty associated with the clear-sky LWestimations, our analyses and comparison with detailed radiative transfer (RT) model calculations suggest our estimations on average are no worse than model calculations that require temporally and spatially averaged input information. Our technique exhibits a high degree of repeatability for the downwelling LW cloud effect, with agreement at about the 3 W m?2 level. Applying our technique and that of Long and Ackerman (2000) to 15 years of data from the ARM SGP site shows the maximum all-sky and clear-sky SW and LWoccurs during summer, with the greatest year-to-year clear-sky SW variability occurring in fall. The downwelling LW cloud effect is fairly constant across the seasons, but the greatest SW cloud effect occurs in spring. The downwelling net cloud effect is dominated by the SW, with the largest effect occurring in spring (64 W/m^2) and the smallest occurring during winter (21 W/m^2).},

An {ISO} outdoor calibration, as well as a system uncertainty analysis and data response time evaluation, were performed, to assure results reliability.

Effects of clouds, the so called “cloud forcing”, can only be determined by explicitly separating clear-sky from all-sky radiation measurements.

This clear-sky index, which has the important advantage to be applicable 24 hours a day, was tested and first used on measurements of the Alpine Sur- face Radiation Budget (ASRB) network, and was of prime importance for the determination of the altitude dependence of cloud forcing and greenhouse effect over the Alps.},

Strong seasonal effects on the monthly averaged TL values are not observed, while their profile displays a smooth transition from lower to higher values. Examination of the daily averages reveals TL values as low as 2.0 and as high as 4.0. The most frequent values of the turbidity are found in the range of 2.3-3.5. Archival global irradiance data from the same site are also used to estimate the turbidity with the aid of a robust estimator and two simple, analytical models. The usefulness of this approach is validated with data from a number of networks registering the solar radiation. The proposed method allows to estimate the turbidity with an rms error of 0.3, using only, good quality, global irradiance data.

  abstract         = {Surface solar irradiance varies on scales down to seconds, and detailed long-term observational datasets of this variable are rare but in high demand. Here, we present an observational dataset of global, direct, and diffuse solar irradiance sampled at 1 Hz as well as fully resolved variability until at least 0.1 Hz over a period of 10 years from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network ({BSRN}) station at Cabauw, the Netherlands. The dataset is complemented with irradiance variability classiﬁcations, clear-sky irradiance and aerosol reanalysis, information about the solar position, observations of clouds and sky type, and wind measurements up to 200 m above ground level. Statistics of variability derived from all time series include approximately 185 000 detected events of both cloud enhancement and cloud shadows. Additional observations from the Cabauw measurement site are freely available from the open-data platform of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. This paper describes the observational site, quality control, classiﬁcation algorithm with validation, and the processing method of complementary products. Additionally, we discuss and showcase (potential) applications, including limitations due to sensor response time. These observations and derived statistics provide detailed information to aid research into how clouds and atmospheric composition inﬂuence solar irradiance variability as well as information to help validate models that are starting to resolve variability at higher ﬁdelity. The main datasets are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7093164 (Knap and Mol, 2022) and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7462362 (Mol et al., 2022); the reader is referred to the “Code and data availability” section of this paper for the complete list.},

In solar radiation database, a quality control that identifies errors and labels the data by means of different flags or indicators is fundamental. Reading and interpretation of flagged data can usually be tedious due to the large numbers of data that have to be handled. This article presents a new type of graphical representation that facilitates the identification and interpretation of data quality by using their flagged values. These graphs represent the results of quality control (QC) for up to one year of measurements with any recording frequency on the same graph, making it easier to identify frequent errors such as incorrect timestamp. The utility of this visual tool to identify the most common errors found in quality control of solar radiation data is exemplified by applying it to the QC performed to 4 databases registered at different locations in Spain. The quality control process followed the recommendations of the Baseline Solar Radiation Network (BSRN).},

This direct effect is partly counterbalanced by a positive semi-direct radiative effect over the Mediterranean Sea (?5.7 Wm-2 on average) and Europe (?5.0 Wm-2) due to changes in cloud cover and atmospheric circulation. The total aerosol effect is consequently negative at the surface and responsible for a decrease in land (on average -0.4 Â°C over Europe, and -0.5 Â°C over northern Africa) and sea surface temperature (on average -0.5 Â°C for the Mediterranean SST). In addition, the latent heat loss is shown to be weaker (-11.0 Wm-2) in the presence of aerosols, resulting in a decrease in specific humidity in the lower troposphere, and a reduction in cloud cover and precipitation. Simulations also indicate that dust aerosols warm the troposphere by absorbing solar radiation, and prevent radiation from reaching the surface, thus stabilizing the troposphere. The comparison with the model response in atmosphere-only simulations shows that these feedbacks are attenuated if SST cannot be modified by aerosols, highlighting the importance of using coupled regional models over the Mediterranean. Oceanic convection is also strengthened by aerosols, which tends to reinforce the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation. In parallel, two case studies are presented to illustrate positive feedbacks between dust aerosols and regional climate. First, the eastern Mediterranean was subject to high dust aerosol loads in June 2007 which reduce land and sea surface temperature, as well as airâ•ﬁsea humidity fluxes. Because of northern wind over the eastern Mediterranean, drier and cooler air has been consequently advected from the sea to the African continent, reinforcing the direct dust effect over land.

This evidence is quantified by the cumulative sum of residual differences from the predicted linear trend. The cumulative residuals indicate that the rate of ozone loss at 35â•ﬁ45 km altitudes globally has diminished. These changes in loss rates are consistent with the slowdown of total stratospheric chlorine increases characterized by HALOE HCl measurements. These changes in the ozone loss rates in the upper stratosphere are significant and constitute the first stage of a recovery of the ozone layer.},

The area of interest is Europe; data from May to September during 13 years (2000e2012) are analyzed. The aerosol effect on DNI is high in areas inﬂuenced by desert dust intrusions and intense anthropogenic activities, such as the Mediterranean basin and the Po Valley in Italy. In May, the attenuation of DNI from aerosols, over these areas, can reach values up to 35% and 45% respectively, which corresponds to 4 and 6 kWh mÀ2 per day. In most areas, even for periods with lower values of AOD, the attenuation of DNI is found to be around 20 which corresponds to about 2 e3 kWh mÀ2 less received DNI per day, compared to the corresponding value on an aerosol clean day. However, the DNI has increased during the recent years, due to the decreasing tendency of AOD over most areas of Europe. The increase is around 6e12 which corresponds to an amount of 0.5e1.25 more kWh mÀ2 received per day, compared to a clean day. The percentage differences of daily DNI from the corresponding monthly climatological value reveals that day-to-day differences (due to AOD changes) from the monthly mean, by Æ20 can occur. The signiﬁcance of the aerosol changes in Europe reveals the necessity for near real-time measurements or forecasts of AOD when reliable estimations of DNI are required.},

Correlations between the measured global solar shortwave radiation and the total aerosol content, Ångström exponent in the visible spectrum, absorption of radiation by aerosols, scattering of radiation by aerosols, Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) of aerosols are calculated using statistical methods. The results show that the underlying surface through its albedo plays a significant role in terms of the radiative effect of aerosols. At low albedo values, the higher aerosol amounts exert, at surface level, a negative radiative effect and vice versa. However, at high albedo values, the higher aerosol amounts exert, at surface level, a positive radiative effect and vice versa. This is due to the fact that a higher albedo leads to larger amounts of reflected and scattered shortwave radiation, especially close to the earthś surface, which at higher aerosol amounts result in an increase in the amount of scattered shortwave radiation, which also increases the global solar shortwave radiation. The relationships between global solar shortwave radiation and aerosols are, in most cases, non-linear, which is due to the statistical distributions of the studied parameters, which are not normal. Disclosed dependencies should be taken into account when modeling the impact of aerosols on climate change.},

It was written for the user of SERI QC, a software package developed by the Analytic Studies Division at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (formerly the Solar Energy Research Institute) for performing quality assessment of data obtained from one-minute to one-hour integrations of solar radiation. It is not applicable for performing quality assessment of daily total solar radiation energy. SERI QC is described from several aspects, and the theory encompassing this approach to postmeasurement quality assessment is discussed. The utility of this software package is illustrated through examples of typical measurement problems. Work on this manual was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's Resource Assessment Program managed by the Photovoltaics Technology Division of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. During the past five years, many people have contributed to the development of SERI QC and this users manual. The concepts were developed by Gene Maxwell, Tom Stoffel, Martin Rymes, and Daryl Myers. The original VAX computer programs were written by Martin Rymes with assistance from Tom Stoffel and Steve Wilcox. All of these people contributed to the development of boundaries and limits defining the expected range of solar radiation values for individual stations and months. The PC version of the code was written by Martin Rymes, Steve Wilcox, and Nancy Birkenheuer. The manual was written by Gene Maxwell, Steve Wilcox, and Martin Rymes.},

  abstract         = {Routine measurements of irradiance are valuable for many research fields such as energy applications. However, ground data of solar global radiation can present questionable values. In this study, a set of check procedures is used to test the quality of shortwave and longwave radiation measurements taken at two actinometric stations in Cyprus (Athalassa-inland location and Larnaca-coastal location), during the period November 2012eJuly 2014. The testing procedures include physically possible limits for all the radiation components and comparisons between global radiation and the sum of direct and diffuse radiation. The quality process is implemented to both the 10-min averaged irradiances, hourly irradiation and the respective daily values. This paper reviews the currently available procedures for quality assessment of the solar shortwave and longwave irradiation data. In the present study, the first level of test includes physical possible limits which are determined by the Daylight Research Group and the Baseline Surface Radiation Network of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). The second level of test is a semi-automated procedure that is based on the creation of an envelope in the clearness index and the diffuse to global irradiance ratio. The third level of test is based on the comparison of various radiation parameters including comparison of measured extreme values with theoretical estimations from clear sky-models. The fourth level of test of the quality control procedure refers to the analysis of daily and annual variations of the radiation parameters.},

  abstract         = {Enhancement of solar irradiance ({IE}) has been observed in many locations under partly cloudy sky conditions. Despite its notoriety, few studies have attempted to systematically examine the underlying mechanism for the event through simulation. As a result, there is no consensus regarding the causes of {IE}, nor an understanding of the effects of cloud optical depth and/or solar elevation on the event. Using a 2D Monte Carlo radiative transfer model ({RTM}), we show that {IE} through a homogenous square cloud is caused by the superposition of a direct irradiance beam with diffuse light scattered through the bottom and out of the edge of a cloud, through Mie and diffusion scattering. Using the {RTM}, we investigated the effect of optical depth up to 40 and solar zenith angles ranging from 0° to 80° on the {IE} magnitude and spatial extent. For the overhead zenith case the {IE} magnitude is maximum between optical depths of 2 and 3, with a value of 1.27 times the clear sky value. {IE} magnitude increases with increasing solar zenith angle, with the maximum occurring at a higher optical depth. The greatest magnitude overall occurred for a solar zenith angle 80° (our maximum) and optical depth of 20, with a value of 1.46 times the clear sky value. The simulations show that for optically thick clouds and small solar zenith angles forward scattering is the dominate contributor to large {IE}, but at increased zenith angles outward scattering leads to larger {IE}’s. Differences between simulated {IE} maximums and measured values in literature were resolved with a simple two cloud model to show mechanisms behind the production of {IE} extremes.},

The graphical method of Gobbi and co-authors (2007) was applied to AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) spectral extinction observations and relies on the combined analysis of the Ångstrom exponent (å) and its spectral curvature Δå. Lidar measurements at 355, 532 and 1064 nm were used in this study to retrieve the vertical profiles of å and Δå and to estimate the dependence on altitude of Rf and η(532 nm) from the å–Δå combined analysis. Lidar measurements were performed at the Department of Mathematics and Physics of the Universita ́del Salento, in south-eastern Italy. Aerosol from continental Europe, the Atlantic, northern Africa, and the Mediterranean Sea are often advected over south-eastern Italy and as a consequence, mixed advection patterns leading to aerosol properties varying with altitude are dominant. The proposed approach was applied to ten measurement days to demonstrate its feasibility in different aerosol load conditions. The selected days were characterized by AOTs spanning the 0.26–0.67, 0.15–0.39, and 0.04–0.27 range at 355, 532, and 1064 nm, respectively. Mean lidar ratios varied within the 31–83, 32–84, and 11–47 sr range at 355, 532, and 1064 nm, respectively, for the high variability of the aerosol optical and microphysical properties. å values calculated from lidar extinction profiles at 355 and 1064 nm ranged between 0.1 and 2.5 with a mean value ± 1 standard deviation equal to 1.3 ± 0.7. Δå varied within the −0.1–1 range with mean value equal to 0.25 ± 0.43. Rf and η(532 nm) values spanning the 0.05–0.3 μm and the 0.3–0.99 range, respectively, were associated with the å–Δå data points. Rf and η values showed no dependence on the altitude. 60% of the data points were in the Δå–å space delimited by the η and Rf curves varying within 0.80–0.99 and 0.05–0.15 μm, respectively, for the dominance of fine-mode particles in driving the AOT over south-eastern Italy. Vertical profiles of the linear particle depolarization ratio retrieved from lidar measurements, aerosol products from AERONET sun photometer measurements collocated in space and time, analytical back trajectories, satellite true colour images, and dust concentrations from the BSC–DREAM (Barcelona Super Computing Center-Dust REgional Atmospheric Model) model were used to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.},

Here we analyse shortwave and longwave surface forcings measured in Switzerland and Northern Germany and relate them to humidity- and temperature increases through the radiation- and energy budget. Shortwave climate forcing from direct aerosol effects is found to be much larger than indirect aerosol cloud forcing, and the total shortwave forcing, that is related to the observed 60% aerosol decline, is two to three times larger than the longwave forcing from rising anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Almost tree quarters of all the shortwave and longwave forcing energy goes into the turbulent fluxes, which increases atmospheric humidity and hence the longwave forcing by water vapour feedback. With anthropogenic aerosols now reaching low and stable values in Europe, solar forcing will subside and future temperature will mainly rise due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming.

Ground data of three BSRN and six AEMet radiometric meteorological stations have been used for assessing the method.

The results were derived graphically (correcting every DS measurement for actual total ozone and SO2 content) and mathematically, subtracting the average Rayleigh, O3 and SO2 optical depth of the total optical depth obtained from Langley plots. The calculated intercept of the Langley plots (ETC) of the Poprad-Gánovce instrument for every day of year will enable to obtain daily AOD information from the Brewer instrument if at least one DS observation is performed. The AOD values do not manifest significant trend in period 1993-2001. The average TOD and AOD for wavelengths 320.1 nm - 306.3 nm varies from 1.41-2.56 and 0.29-0.40, respectively. The aerosol share on total direct solar UV radiation attenuation varies from 11.4% at 306.3 nm to 26.2% at 320.1 nm. Between examined parameters significantly affecting the direct clear sky UV radiation in the atmosphere, the total aerosol content is the most variable.

  abstract         = {NASA recently extended the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application (MERRA) with an atmospheric aerosol reanalysis which includes five particulate species: sulfate, organic matter, black carbon, mineral dust and sea salt. The MERRA Aerosol Reanalysis (MERRAero) is an innovative tool to study air quality issues around the world for its global and constant coverage and its distinction of aerosol speciation expressed in the form of aerosol optical depth (AOD). The purpose of this manuscript is to apply MERRAero to the study of urban air pollution at the global scale by analyzing the AOD over a period of 13 years (2003–2015) and over a selection of 200 of the world's most populated cities in order to assess the impacts of urbanization, industrialization, air quality regulations and regional transport which affect urban aerosol load. Environmental regulations and the recent global economic recession helped to decrease the AOD and sulfate aerosols in most cities of North America, Europe and Japan. Rapid industrialization in China over the last two decades resulted in Chinese cities having the highest AOD values in the world. China has nevertheless recently implemented emission control measures, which are showing early signs of success in many cities of Southern China, where AOD decreased substantially over the last 13 years. The AOD over South American cities, dominated by carbonaceous aerosols, also decreased over the last decade due to an increase in commodity prices which slowed deforestation activities in the Amazon rainforest. At the opposite, recent urbanization and industrialization in India and Bangladesh resulted in a strong increase of AOD, sulfate and carbonaceous aerosols in most cities of these two countries. The AOD over most cities in Northern Africa and Western Asia changed little over the last decade. Emissions of natural aerosols, which cities in these two regions tend to be mostly impacted by, don't tend to fluctuate significantly on an annual basis.},

  abstract         = {Based on sensitivity of total direct solar radiation (DSR) detected by a pyrheliometer for aerosol physical–optical properties, a method is proposed to retrieve the 0.75-μm aerosol optical depth from the radiation, and an iteration inversion algorithm and a parameterized DSR model are developed. A key question of the method is the effect of aerosol size distribution uncertainty on the depth solution. As shown in inversion simulations using Junge size distributions and LOWTRAN7 aerosol models, a depth accuracy better than 5% can generally be expected for a solar zenith angle less than 75% if a Junge distribution with exponent ϭ 3 is selected for the retrievals. In general, the smaller the depth and solar zenith angle, the higher the accuracy. In addition, it is important for improving solution accuracy to exactly determine the DSR and water vapor absorptance. If errors in DSR and the vertical water vapor amount are within Ϯ2% and Ϯ0.2 cm, resultant depth errors are usually within Ϯ0.02 and Ϯ0.013, respectively. The method is tested for comparative observations using a phyrheliometer and sunphotometer. There are 1267 sets of comparitive aerosol optical depths measured over 25 days. Results show that the 0.75-μm aerosol optical depths measured by the pyrheliometer conform well with those of the sunphotometer. Standard deviation of the total 1267 sets of optical depth is 10.2 and the difference between two average optical depths is only 1.2%.},

  abstract         = {There are two important problems in the aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals from hourly/daily/monthly accumulated pyrheliometer data, that is, how to select a suitable cosine of the solar zenith angle (␮0) and how to eliminate or minimize cloud effects. In this paper, two models of ‘‘equivalent’’ ␮0 are developed for two cases of hourly and daily pyrheliometer data. As shown in retrieval simulations, relative standard errors of 0.75␮m-wavelength AOD solutions caused by the model uncertainties are, respectively, 0.77% and 1.93% in the two cases. Then, an approach is proposed to select AOD data from the total optical depths retrieved from hourly/ daily pyrheliometer data probably containing cloud contribution. The approach uses additional cloud fraction, surface visibility, and relative humidity data to constrain the AOD upper limit and then to minimize the cloud effect on the monthly/yearly mean AOD estimations. The limit decreases with an increase of cloud fraction. Furthermore, in the case of the AOD retrieval using joint data of total monthly direct solar radiation and sunshine duration, two error factors, that is, the optically thin (solar transparent) cirrus cloud effect and the difference between radiation limits of pyrheliometer and sunshine recorder, are analyzed and an improved inversion method is proposed. The AOD selection approach is tested in two kinds of practical AOD retrieval comparisons. Eleven representative meteorological observatories are selected in the ﬁrst kind of comparisons of AODs from hourly/ daily/monthly pyrheliometer data during 1993–2000. It is found that the AOD selection approach is available to minimize the cloud effect for stable and reasonable monthly/yearly mean AOD estimations. In the case of hourly pyrheliometer data for 1995, the maximum relative deviation between yearly mean AODs, retrieved by using different cloud fraction limits from 0.0 to 60 is less than 7.9% for all 11 sites. Another kind of comparison between AODs from sun photometer and pyrheliometer data also shows the effectiveness of the AOD selection approach to minimize the cloud effect.},

Without an uncertainty statement, the quality of a result, model, or testing method cannot be quantified, the chain of traceability is broken, and confidence cannot be maintained in the measurement. Measurement results are incomplete and meaningless without a statement of the estimated uncertainty with traceability to the International System of Units (SI) or to another internationally recognized standard. This report explains how to use International Guidelines of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) to calculate such uncertainty. The report also shows that without appropriate corrections to solar measuring instruments (solar radiometers), the uncertainty of measuring shortwave solar irradiance can exceed 4% using present state-of-the-art pyranometers and 2.7% using present state-of-the-art pyrheliometers. Finally, the report demonstrates that by applying the appropriate corrections, uncertainties may be reduced by at least 50%. The uncertainties, with or without the appropriate corrections might not be compatible with the needs of solar energy and atmospheric science applications; yet, this report may shed some light on the sources of uncertainties and the means to reduce overall uncertainty in measuring solar irradiance.},

The best uncertainty achieved in most of these articles is greater than 0.01 in calculating the solar zenith and azimuth angles. For some, the algorithm is valid for a limited number of years varying from 15 years to a hundred years. This report is a step by step procedure for implementing an algorithm to calculate the solar zenith and azimuth angles in the period from the year -2000 to 6000, with uncertainties of 0.0003. The algorithm is described in a book written by Jean Meeus in 1998. This report is written in a step by step format to simplify the complicated steps described in the book, with a focus on the sun instead of the planets and stars in general. It also introduces some changes to accommodate for solar radiation applications. The changes include changing the direction of measuring azimuth angles to be measured from north and eastward instead of being measured from south and eastward, and the direction of measuring the observer's geographical longitude to be measured as positive eastward from Greenwich meridian instead of negative. This report also includes the calculation of incidence angle for a surface that is tilted to any horizontal and vertical angle, as described by Iqbals in 1983.},

  abstract         = {The integrity of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network ({BSRN}) radiation monthly averages are assessed by investigating the impact on monthly means due to the frequency of data gaps caused by missing or discarded high time resolution data. The monthly statistics, especially means, are considered to be important and useful values for climate research, model performance evaluations and for assessing the quality of satellite (time- and space-averaged) data products. The study investigates the spread in different algorithms that have been applied for the computation of monthly means from 1-min values. The paper reveals that the computation of monthly means from 1-min observations distinctly depends on the method utilized to account for the missing data. The intra-method difference generally increases with an increasing fraction of missing data. We found that a substantial fraction of the radiation fluxes observed at {BSRN} sites is either missing or flagged as questionable. The percentage of missing data is 4.4\%, 13.0\%, and 6.5\% for global radiation, direct shortwave radiation, and downwelling longwave radiation, respectively. Most flagged data in the shortwave are due to nighttime instrumental noise and can reasonably be set to zero after correcting for thermal offsets in the daytime data. The study demonstrates that the handling of flagged data clearly impacts on monthly mean estimates obtained with different methods. We showed that the spread of monthly shortwave fluxes is generally clearly higher than for downwelling longwave radiation. Overall, {BSRN} observations provide sufficient accuracy and completeness for reliable estimates of monthly mean values. However, the value of future data could be further increased by reducing the frequency of data gaps and the number of outliers. It is shown that two independent methods for accounting for the diurnal and seasonal variations in the missing data permit consistent monthly means to within less than 1 W m\$-\$2 in most cases. The authors suggest using a standardized method for the computation of monthly means which addresses diurnal variations in the missing data in order to avoid a mismatch of future published monthly mean radiation fluxes from {BSRN}. The application of robust statistics would probably lead to less biased results for data records with frequent gaps and/or flagged data and outliers. The currently applied empirical methods should, therefore, be completed by the development of robust methods.},

  abstract         = {Within MAP, one of the scientific projects was devoted to ‘Boundary Layers in Complex Terrain.́ In a number of subprojects, boundary-layer issues were addressed and detailed high-resolution multi-sensor observations were combined with simulation by models allowing for adequate parametrization of turbulence processes. In this contribution, the projects are briefly introduced and an attempt is made to summarize their key findings and to put them into a joint perspective. Spatial variability is found to be large but strictly related to topography and therefore allowing for possible parametrization. Traditional boundary-layer scaling approaches cannot simply be applied over highly complex topography, but some of the MAP findings suggest the potential for suitable extensions of those scaling relations to cover various cases of complex terrain. The mean boundary-layer structure and thermally driven flows in narrow valleys are found not to be generally in line with previous results from larger valleys elsewhere. Furthermore, local circulations are reported to contribute considerably to exchange between valley and free troposphere. In particular, the range of their effects on the lower atmosphere seems to be larger than just turbulent transport within the planetary boundary layer would suggest. Thus in larger-scale numerical models where the topography is not resolved, possible sub-grid parametrizations for local exchange seem to be in order.},

It uses global horizontal irradiance ({GHI}) measurements at 1-min resolution, from which a set of four indices is derived to characterize the magnitude and temporal variability of {GHI}. The algorithm also requires precise estimates of 1-min {GHI} under hypothetical cloudless conditions, and the solar zenith angle (limited to a maximum of 85◦). Using 1-min {GHI} measurements from 54 {BSRN} high-quality radiometric stations, which cover all five primary Ko¨ppen-Geiger climate classes, {CAELUS} is used here to clas­ sify their sky conditions. The classification results, including the distribution of sky classes and the transitions between consecutive sky classes, are found consistent with the known characteristics of each primary Ko¨{ppenGeiger} climate. Moreover, in each climate class, the detection of 1-min cloudless situations is found comparable to that provided by two dedicated and state-of-the-art methods—{RENO}-{HANSEN} and {BRIGHT}-{SUN}.},

Two different periods have become evident in the analyzed time series of solar radiation: a statistically significant decrease in the annual totals of global and direct solar radiation has been detected for the period from 1955 to the beginning of the 1990s, while opposite trends have become evident during more recent years. These changes are in correlation with the changes in the amount of low clouds and in the transparency of cloudless atmosphere (atmospheric aerosol loading). Unlike solar radiation, annual mean temperature has continuously increased during 1955-2007. No time intervals with different slopes have been found in its time series. Because of the relatively short sunshine duration and low Sun elevations, the impact of solar dimming and brightening on the observed warming has turned out to be negligible in the Baltic Sea region.

Concurrently, emissions of anthropogenic aerosols will decline, due to coemission with {GHG}, and measures to improve air quality. However, the combined climate effect of {GHG} and aerosol emissions over the industrial era is poorly constrained. Here we show the climate impacts from removing present-day anthropogenic aerosol emissions and compare them to the impacts from moderate {GHG}-dominated global warming. Removing aerosols induces a global mean surface heating of 0.5–1.1°C, and precipitation increase of 2.0–4.6\%. Extreme weather indices also increase. We ﬁnd a higher sensitivity of extreme events to aerosol reductions, per degree of surface warming, in particular over the major aerosol emission regions. Under near-term warming, we ﬁnd that regional climate change will depend strongly on the balance between aerosol and {GHG} forcing. Plain Language Summary To keep within 1.5 or 2° of global warming, we need massive reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, aerosol emissions will be strongly reduced. We show how cleaning up aerosols, predominantly sulfate, may add an additional half a degree of global warming, with impacts that strengthen those from greenhouse gas warming. The northern hemisphere is found to be more sensitive to aerosol removal than greenhouse gas warming, because of where the aerosols are emitted today. This means that it does not only matter whether or not we reach international climate targets. It also matters how we get there.},

  abstract         = {There is a worldwide tendency to replace Dobson spectrophotometers in ground-based total ozone (TOZ) measurements by more advanced Brewer spectrophotometers. Ensuring the homogeneity of these data sets is of utmost importance if changes in TOZ of a few percent over long time periods are to be diagnosed accurately. Previous studies have identified a seasonal bias of a few percent between midlatitude Brewer and Dobson measurements. At Arosa (Switzerland), two Dobson and three Brewer instruments have been colocated since 1998, providing a unique data set of quasi-simultaneous observations, invaluable to study systematic differences between these measurements. The differences are partially attributed to the seasonal variability in atmospheric temperatures and ozone slant paths (OSP). The sensitivity to the temperature dependence of the ozone absorption cross section is calculated for each operational Brewer spectrophotometers at Arosa by using different high- and low-resolution reference spectra appropriately weighted with the instruments ́slit functions, whereas the information on the primary standard instruments is used for all the Dobson instruments. The Brewer retrieval algorithm reveals a higher sensitivity to the reference spectra applied than the Dobson. When adopting the Bass and Paur (1985) or Malicet et al. (1995) ozone absorption spectra with their specific temperature dependence, and correcting for the OSP effect, the seasonal bias between Dobson and Brewer TOZ measurements is reduced to 0.6%. Conversely, these differences increase when using the spectral data of Burrows et al. (1999). This finding illustrates that the accuracy of ground-based spectrophotometric TOZ measurements is limited by the uncertainty in the ozone cross sections measured by different internationally leading laboratories.},

  abstract         = {The amount of solar (shortwave) radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface underwent substantial variations over recent decades. Since the 1950s, surface shortwave radiation gradually decreased at widespread locations. In Europe, this so-called surface dimming continued until the late 1980s, when surface brightening set in and surface shortwave radiation increased again. In China, the dimming levelled off in the 1980s, but did not turn into brightening until 2005. Changes in clouds and aerosol are the prime potential causes for the phenomenon, but the scientific community has not yet reached a consensus about the relative role of the different potential forcing agents. Here we bring together co-located long-term observational data from surface and space to study decadal changes of the shortwave energy balance in Europe and China from 1985 to 2015. Within this observation-based framework, we show that an increasing net shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere and a decreasing atmospheric shortwave absorption each contribute roughly half of the observed brightening trends in Europe. For China, we find that the continued dimming until 2005 and the subsequent brightening occurred despite opposing trends in the top-of-the-atmosphere net shortwave radiation. This shows that changes in atmospheric shortwave absorption are a major driver of European brightening and the dominant cause for the Chinese surface trends. Although the observed variations cannot be attributed unambiguously, we discuss potential causes for the observed changes.},

We show that a combination of down and up-looking observations provides sufficient measurement constraints for characterizing both aerosol and surface properties with minimal assumptions. In order to employ this concept in AERONET processing, the standard inverse algorithm [Dubovik, O. & King, M. D. (2000), A flexible inversion algorithm for retrieval of aerosol optical properties from sun and sky radiance measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research, 105, 20673-20696] has been modified to retrieve surface reflectance in addition to aerosol parameters when co-incident satellite measurements are available. The method was applied to observations of smoke and desert dust over the Mongu (Zambia) and Solar Village (Saudi Arabia) AERONET sites respectively. The AERONET data were complemented by available observations from the MISR, MODIS, and POLDER-2 satellite sensors. The retrieved bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) and surface albedo comparison shows good agreement between results obtained using observations from different satellites. The robustness of the method is tested by analyzing surface albedo time series retrieved during periods of high aerosol optical depth variability and low seasonal changes in surface reflectance. The analysis shows that the performance of retrieval algorithm is stable under different aerosol loadings. It is shown that much of the observed surface albedo temporal variability could be attributed mostly to the combined uncertainty in satellite radiometric calibration and aerosol vertical distribution for Mongu and to differences in satellite angular sampling on different days for Solar Village. The sensitivity of surface retrievals to assumptions on aerosol vertical distribution and aerosol particle shape are analyzed. It is found that the maximum error in retrieved surface albedo at 0.44 μm is 0.035 for aerosol optical depth 0.85 at 0.44 μm. For aerosol optical depths lower than ∼ 0.7 the error in retrieved surface albedo is less than 0.02. Analysis of particle shape assumptions on surface retrievals showed that aerosol particle non-sphericity significantly affects the angular shape of BRF, but not the surface albedo. Finally, the sensitivity of AERONET aerosol retrievals to uncertainty in assumed surface reflectance is analyzed by comparing aerosol retrievals obtained with different surface assumptions. It is found that the uncertainty in surface reflectance model employed in the version 1 AERONET operational algorithm is larger than was previously assumed in [Dubovik, O., Smirnov, A., Holben, B. N., King, M. D., Kaufman, Y. J., Eck, T. F., & Slutsker, I. (2000), Accuracy assessment of aerosol optical properties retrieved from AERONET sun and sky radiance measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research, 105, 9791-9806] and may have more significant effect on the retrieved aerosol properties than was documented in that work. In particular, larger errors were encountered for the real part of the refractive index (∼ 0.05-0.07 increase) and maximum of the particle size distribution (∼ 20% decrease) retrievals for the Mongu case, when the aerosol optical depth was relatively small (∼ 0.4 at 0.44 μm). The retrieved single scattering albedo uncertainties were within the error bars (0.03) estimated in [Dubovik, O., Smirnov, A., Holben, B. N., King, M. D., Kaufman, Y. J., Eck, T. F., & Slutsker, I. (2000), Accuracy assessment of aerosol optical properties retrieved from AERONET sun and sky radiance measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research, 105, 9791-9806], with the exception of the 0.44 μm retrievals for the desert dust case when they increased by ∼ 0.09 and 0.07 for low and high aerosol loadings respectively. textcopyright 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The classification process utilizes the UV Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) at 340 nm and the Extinction Angstrom Exponent (EAE) at 320-360 nm that are obtained from the spectrophotometer. The analysis is supported by measurements from a CIMEL sunphotometer that were deployed in order to establish the training dataset of Brewer measurements. By applying the Mahalanobis distance algorithm to the Brewer timeseries, we automatically assigned measurements in one of the following clusters: Fine Non Absorbing Mixtures (FNA): 64.7%, Black Carbon Mixtures (BC): 17.4%, Dust Mixtures (DUST): 8.1%, and Mixed: 9.8%. We examined the clustering potential of the algorithm by reclassifying the training dataset and comparing it with the original one and also by using manually classified cases. The typing score of the Mahalanobis algorithm is high for all predominant clusters FNA: 77.0%, BC: 63.9%, and DUST: 80.3% when compared with the training dataset. We obtained high scores as well FNA: 100.0%, BC: 66.7%, and DUST: 83.3% when comparing it with the manually classified dataset. The flags obtained here were applied in the timeseries of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 340 nm of the Brewer and the CIMEL in order to compare between the two and also stress the future impact of the proposed clustering technique in climatological studies of the station.},

The strength of such networks relies on imposing a standardization of measurement and processing, allowing multiyear and large-scale comparisons. The development of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) for systematic ground-based sunphotometer measurements of aerosol optical depth is an essential and evolving step in this process. The growing database requires the development of a consistent, reproducible, and system-wide cloud-screening procedure. This paper discusses the methodology and justification of the cloud-screening algorithm developed for the AERONET database. The procedure has been comprehensively tested on experimental data obtained in different geographical and optical conditions. These conditions include biomass burning events in Brazil and Zambia, hazy summer conditions in the Washington DC area, clean air advected from the Canadian Arctic, and variable cloudy conditions. For various sites our screening algorithm eliminates from similar to 20% to 50% of the initial data depending on cloud conditions. Certain shortcomings of the proposed procedure are discussed.

In cases when only global irradiance measurements are available, separation models are a useful method to estimate {DNI} and diffuse irradiation. Several of such models have been developed since the 1960s, most of them aiming to deliver estimates in hourly resolution. For higher data resolution, such as in minute data, those models are not able to describe fast transient and cloud enhancement phenomena commonly observed in data with smaller time-steps. This paper proposes an adaptation of the {BRL} separation model, making it capable of delivering more precise irradiance estimates for higher resolution data. Two models result from this adaptation: one for Brazil and other for Australia. The proposed models yield a more precise {DNI} and diffuse fraction estimates to their respective countries, compared to other separation models commonly used in the technical literature. For example, using the recommended Combined Performance Index ({CPI}) as a single statistical indicator, the proposed model yields {DNI} estimates with {CPI} from 230 to 350\% for Australia, and from 270 to 800\% for Brazil, while the Engerer model, recently recommended as a ‘‘quasi-universal” 1-min separation model, yields {DNI} estimates with {CPI} from 500 to 700\% for Australia, and from 600 to 1800\% for Brazil.},

  abstract         = {As the world looks for low-carbon sources of energy, solar power stands out as the most abundant energy resource. Harnessing this energy is the challenge for this century. Photovoltaics and concentrating solar power (CSP) are two primary forms of electricity generation using sunlight. These use different technologies, collect different fractions of the solar resource, and have different siting and production capabilities. Although PV systems are most often deployed as distributed generation sources, CSP systems favor large, centrally located systems. Accordingly, large CSP systems require a substantial investment, sometimes exceeding 1 billion in construction costs. Before such a project is undertaken, the best possible information about the quality and reliability of the fuel source must be made available. That is, project developers need to have reliable data about the solar resource available at specific locations to predict the daily and annual performance of a proposed CSP plant. Without these data, no financial analysis is possible. This handbook presents detailed information about solar resource data and the resulting data products needed for each stage of the project.},

  abstract         = {During cloudy conditions, the presence of clouds in the sky in relation to the sun's position may result in obscuring the sun's direct irradiance to a Photovoltaic Park, and thus in a reduction in the solar irradiance directly, and in energy production indirectly. Nevertheless, during partially cloudy conditions, diffuse irradiance at the PV park may be enhanced due to the reflection of solar irradiance from the base of the clouds and from the scattering of direct irradiance due to cloud particles. Such periods of enhanced solar irradiance may last from several seconds to some minutes depending on the cloud motion. This paper presents measurements of enhanced global irradiance from data obtained in Cyprus (latitude 34.7 N, longitude 32.6 E), during the spring and summer of 2010. On seven occasions in five different days of May and June, the measured value of global irradiance exceeded 1500 Wm^2 that corresponds to 150% of the theoretical value computed by Bird and Hulstrom clear-sky computational model for those specific occasions. Moreover, it is noteworthy that in more than 20 days of April, May and June, the 1 min and 10min average global irradiance exceeded 1200 Wm^2 (enhanced by 125% compared to the theoretical ensembled averaged value for those specific occasions) showing a long lasting period of this effect. These long periods of high irradiance values, along with the temperature drop due to the presence of clouds (the ambient temperature in the summer near noon is in the range of 30e40 C while the measured temperature was in the range of 15e20 C) might boost the performance of photovoltaic modules and cause irreparable damage to photovoltaic inverters.},

Other important factors of global change interacting synergistically with climatic factors are also mentioned, such as atmospheric {CO}2 concentration, eutrophication, ozone or changes in land-use. Topics addressed are general species distribution and populations (persistence, acclimation, genetic variability, dispersal, fragmentation, plant/animal interaction, species richness, conservation), potential response of vegetation (ecotonal shift – area, physiography – changes in the composition, structural changes), phenology, growth and productivity, and landscape. In conclusion, the European Alps appear to have a natural inertia and thus to tolerate an increase of 1–2 K of mean air temperature as far as plant species and ecosystems are concerned in general. However, the impact of land-use is very likely to negate this buffer in many areas. For a change of the order of 3 K or more, profound changes may be expected.},

Thus the aerosol optical depth (AOD) characteristics and seasonality, as well as the cloudiness, have been investigated in order to provide a robust estimation of the calibration accuracy, as well as the number of days that are suitable for Langley calibrations. The data used for the investigations belong to AERONET and GAW-PFR networks, which maintain reference Sun photometers at these stations with long measurement records: 22 years at Mauna Loa and 15 years at Izaña. In terms of clear sky and stable aerosol conditions, Mauna Loa (3397m a.s.l.) exhibits on average of 377 Langleys (243 morning and 134 afternoon) per year suitable for Langley plot calibration, whereas Izaña (2373m a.s.l.) shows 343 Langleys (187 morning and 155 afternoon) per year. The background AOD (500nm wavelength) values, on days that are favorable for Langley calibrations, are in the range 0.01--0.02 throughout the year, with well-defined seasonality that exhibits a spring maximum at both stations plus a slight summer increase at Izaña. The statistical analysis of the long-term determination of extraterrestrial signals yields to a calibration uncertainty of ∼0.2--0.5%, being this uncertainty smaller in the near infrared and larger in the ultraviolet wavelengths. This is due to atmospheric variability that cannot be reduced based only on quality criteria of individual Langely plots.},

During each of these periods, the direct normal and global horizontal components of solar irradiation were measured, which allows determination of the atmospheric turbidity (Linke turbidity factor, TtextlessinftextgreaterLtextless/inftextgreater, and Angström exponent, β) and of the diffuse fraction (. DtextlessinftextgreaterFtextless/inftextgreater) of the irradiation. In parallel, surface aerosols were sampled on filters and subsequently submitted to X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis for determination of their elemental composition and apportionment between the mineral dust (MD), sea salt (SS), and non sea salt sulfate (nSS) species. A significant positive correlation is found between the total aerosol concentration and both TtextlessinftextgreaterLtextless/inftextgreater and DtextlessinftextgreaterFtextless/inftextgreater, which indicates that over the measurement period surface aerosol is representative of the columnar particulate content of the atmosphere. A least square iterative routine used to separate the effects of each aerosol type shows that if on average MD, SS, and nSS explain 4, 19 and 12 respectively, of the TtextlessinftextgreaterLtextless/inftextgreater values, the increase of the MD concentrations during short-duration dust event is responsible for the largest observed values (. TtextlessinftextgreaterLtextless/inftextgreater=. 6 on 15 April 2010). Similarly, if on average only about 9% of the global horizontal surface irradiation can be ascribed to aerosols, during the aforementioned dust event this share reaches 28 19% of which are due to mineral dust.},

We use 1–min averages of GHI, sunshine duration and synchronized estimations of cloud coverage and type from a digital imaging system. A radiative transfer model is used to estimate GHI under clear skies. For solar zenith angles lower than 80°, 4% of total GHI measurements are considered as enhancements. It is shown that the effect of thick clouds on the GHI enhancements is significantly higher when compared to the thin ones. We also examine cases that correspond to instantaneous clearness index values higher than 1 (Kt > 1): 228 extreme enhancement events are found including 5 cases with GHI values higher than 1367 W/m2 and a maximum value of 1420 W/m2.

These differences can in-fluence estimation of ozone trends if combined data series are used after replacement of the Dobson instrument by the Brewer spectrophotometer. The differences are mostly attributed to the influence of ozone effective temperature on ozone absorption coeffi-cients and to total sulphur dioxide. Similar seasonal differences exist between Dobson, 10 GOME and Brewer, TOMS data sets at Hradec Kralove while Dobson versus TOMS and Brewer versus GOME observations fit well with each other within the instrumental accuracy of spectrophotometers. The above findings are supposed to be relevant to other mid and high latitude stations and they have been confirmed by several inde-pendent analyses. The conclusions should be considered by data users because the 15 differences between particular ground and satellite data sets can influence validation of satellite ozone observing systems and analyses of recovery of the ozone layer in mid and high latitudes, among others.},

The uncertainties are derived using the methodology specified by the “Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement.” The differences between redundant determinations of direct, diffuse, and global irradiance are analyzed and are shown to be compatible with the uncertainties. In addition, the signatures of some uncertainty sources are sought within the error statistics to find out if corrections can be applied and what their magnitude is. The global and diffuse irradiance uncertainties range from 1.8% to 2.4% without correction and are less than 1.8% with corrections. These uncertainties are close to or satisfy the BSRN targets for large signals (global: 1000 W m?2,diffuse:500 Wm?2). For small signals (50 W m?2), the targets are not achieved, mainly as a result of uncertainties associated with the data acquisition electronics (DAQ). The direct irradiance uncertainty is ∼1.5%, 3 times larger than the BSRN uncertainty target. An accuracy gain can also be achieved at the DAQ level, but even without considering the DAQ uncertainty, the target is exceeded by a factor of about 2. The direct irradiance uncertainty remains ∼1% even using an absolute cavity radiometer as transfer standard for correcting the pyrheliometer sensitivity. Thus, the direct irradiance accuracy target of 0.5% is probably not achievable with the best commercially available technology.},

  abstract         = {Regional climate model has been widely used to simulate terrestrial water cycles, but its simulations used in the long-term agriculture drought reconstruction have not been investigated in China. This study presents an analysis of soil moisture ({SM}) drought in China during 1911–2010 on the basis of the simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting ({WRF}) model driven by two twentieth century reanalysis products. Comparisons of modelled {SM} with station observations indicate that {WRF} has certain capability in reproducing its magnitudes and temporal variabilities. Model performance are greatly impacted by lateral boundary conditions. The average {SM} derived from two experiments is closer to observations than the individual one and thus they are then applied in drought investigation. During the study period, {SM} shows a wetting tendency from northwestern to central eastern China, while it displays a drying tendency in the northeast, western Tibetan Plateau, and part of southeastern China. The spatial pattern of number drought events resembles that of annual precipitation, showing an increasing tendency from northwestern (arid) to southeastern (humid) regions. In arid regions, drought events are generally prolonged and frequent but less severe. In humid regions, in contrast, drought events usually persist less than 6 months and are less frequent but relatively severe. During the examined 100-year period, roughly 28.4, 28.9 and 38.4\% of land areas in China show significant trends for duration, severity, and frequency, respectively (p {\textgreater} .8). Both drought duration and severity show decreasing tendencies in vast regions, and the land areas showing increased drought frequency is slightly less than that of areas showing its decreased tendency. This study is a first attempt to apply regional climate modelling to investigate a centennial long {SM} change in China and presents a new way to explore long-term drought characteristics and their changes.},

Both chronologies show strong relations to summer season precipitation, relative humidity, and temperature. We applied linear transfer functions and developed a summer season precipitation and a summer season relative humidity reconstruction. Moisture conditions during the past six centuries were characterized by a more humid period during 1700--1850 {CE} and a drying trend since the mid-19th century. Spatial correlations between the d18O chronologies and gridded reanalysis data ({ERA}-20C) revealed strong regional and remote associations to west central Asian, northeastern Europe, and to the western equatorial Pacific.

Here I review the evidence for these changes, their magnitude, their possible causes, their representation in climate models, and their potential implications for climate change. The various studies analyzing long-term records of surface radiation measurements suggest a widespread decrease in surface solar radiation between the 1950s and 1980s ("global dimming"), with a partial recovery more recently at many locations ("brightening"). There are also some indications for an "early brightening" in the first part of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century. These variations are in line with independent long-term observations of sunshine duration, diurnal temperature range, pan evaporation, and, more recently, satellite-derived estimates, which add credibility to the existence of these changes and their larger-scale significance. Current climate models, in general, tend to simulate these decadal variations to a much lesser degree. The origins of these variations are internal to the Earthś atmosphere and not externally forced by the Sun. Variations are not only found under cloudy but also under cloud-free atmospheres, indicative of an anthropogenic contribution through changes in aerosol emissions governed by economic developments and air pollution regulations. The relative importance of aerosols, clouds, and aerosol-cloud interactions may differ depending on region and pollution level. Highlighted are further potential implications of dimming and brightening for climate change, which may affect global warming, the components and intensity of the hydrological cycle, the carbon cycle, and the cryosphere among other climate elements.

Any change in this precious energy source affects our habitats profoundly. Until recently, for simplicity and lack of better knowledge, the amount of solar radiation received at the Earthś surface was assumed to be stable over the years. However, there is increasing observational evidence that this quantity undergoes significant multidecadal variations, which need to be accounted for in discussions of climate change and mitigation strategies. Coherent periods and regions with prevailing declines ("dimming") and inclines ("brightening") in surface solar radiation have been detected in the worldwide observational networks, often in accord with anthropogenic air pollution patterns. The present synthesis provides in a nutshell the main characteristics of this phenomenon, a conceptual framework for its causes, and an overview of potential environmental implications. The latest developments and remaining gaps of knowledge in this rapidly growing field of research are further highlighted. textcopyright 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

We identify cloud-free days based on synop cloud observations as well as on days with maximum atmospheric transmission. Irrespective of the cloud-screening method, strong dimming and brightening tendencies in the atmospheric transmission are evident not only under all-sky but also of similar magnitude under clear-sky conditions, causing multidecadal variations in surface solar radiation on the order of 10 Wm−2. This points to the cloud-free atmosphere as a main responsible for dimming and brightening in central Europe and suggests that these variations are anthropogenically forced rather than of natural origin, with aerosol pollutants as likely major drivers.},

Aerosol properties derived from Sun photometer measurements and aerosol-induced changes in downwelling shortwave surface irradiances are analyzed in this paper. It is shown that the mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm is 0.63. The day-to-day variation of aerosol optical depth is dramatic, with a maximum daily AOD close to 2.0 and a minimum value close to the background level. Dust activities generally produce heavy aerosol loading characterized by larger particle sizes and less absorption than those observed under normal conditions. The reduction of instantaneous direct shortwave surface irradiance per unit of AOD is 404.5 W M<sup>-2</sup>. About 63.8% of this reduction is offset by an increase in diffuse irradiance; consequently, one unit increase in AOD leads to a decrease in global surface irradiance of 146.3 W m<sup>-2</sup>. The diurnal aerosol direct radiative forcing efficiency is about -47.4 W m<sup>-2</sup>. Overall, aerosols reduce about 30 W m<sup>-2</sup> per day of surface net shortwave irradiance in this suburban region. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Using ground AOD measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and the Distributed Regional Aerosol Gridded Observation Networks (DRAGON)-Asia Campaign, as well as from handheld sunphotometers, we evaluated emerging aerosol products from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP), the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) aboard the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorology Satellite (COMS), and Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Collection 6) in East Asia in 2012 and 2013. In the case study in Beijing, when compared with AOD measured by handheld sunphotometers, 51 % of VIIRS Environmental Data Record (EDR) AOD, 33 % of VIIRS Intermediate Product (IP) AOD, 31 % of GOCI AOD, 26 % of Terra MODIS C6 3 km AOD, and 16 % of Aqua MODIS C6 3 km AOD fell within the reference expected error (EE) envelop (Â±0.05 Â± 0.15 AOD). Comparing against AERONET measurements over the Japanâ•ﬁSouth Korea region, 64 % of EDR, 37 % of IP, 62 % of GOCI, 39 % of Terra MODIS and 56 % of Aqua MODIS C6 3 km AOD fell within the EE.

studies worldwide, in this study, during the period between 1961 and the early
1980s, a negative trend in surface solar irradiation was detected in
São Paulo, characterizing the occurrence of a dimming effect. Sunshine
duration and the diurnal temperature range also presented negative trends,
in opposition to the positive trend observed in the cloud cover fraction.
However, a brightening effect, as observed in western industrialized
countries in more recent years, was not observed. Instead, for surface
downward irradiation, the negative trend persisted, with a trend of −0.13 {MJ} m−2 per decade, with a p value of 0.006, for the 56 years of data and
in consonance with the cloud cover fraction increasing trend, but not
statistically significant, of 0.3 \% per decade (p value = 0.198). The
trends for sunshine duration and the diurnal temperature range, by contrast,
changed signal, as confirmed by a piecewise linear regression model. Some
possible causes for the discrepancy are discussed, such as the frequency of
fog occurrence, urban heat island effects, horizontal visibility (as a proxy
for aerosol loading variability) and greenhouse gas concentration increase.
Future studies on the aerosol effect are planned, particularly with higher
temporal resolution, as well as modelling studies, to better analyse the
contribution of each possible cause.},

There is thus a need for taking measurements of solar irradiation and creating local and regional databases of irradiation and synoptic (meteorological) information. However, there is no guarantee of the quality of the data collected, as often due care is not exercised with respect to quality control of the measured dataset. This article reviews the presently available procedures for quality assessment of the solar irradiation data. Furthermore, we propose a set of stringent physical and statistical measures to create a semi-automated procedure that is based on the creation of an envelope in the clearness index-diffuse to global irradiance ratio domain. The procedure is very general in nature and may be used with equal effectiveness for any terrestrial dataset.},

Current procedures for clear-sky data extraction have been examined and compared with each other to determine their reliability and location dependency. New clear-sky determination algorithms are proposed that are based on a combination of clearness index, diffuse ratio, cloud cover and Linkeś turbidity limits. Various researchers have proposed clear-sky irradiance models that rely on synoptic parameters; four of these models, MRM, PRM, YRM and REST2 have been compared for six world-wide-locations. Based on a previously-developed comprehensive accuracy scoring method, the models MRM, REST2 and YRM were found to be of satisfactory performance in decreasing order. The so-called Page radiation model (PRM) was found to underestimate solar radiation, even though local turbidity data were provided for its operation. ©2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract         = {Downward surface solar radiation ({SSR}) is a crucial component of the global energy balance, affecting temperature and the hydrological cycle profoundly, and it provides crucial information about climate change. Many studies have examined {SSR} trends; however, they have often concentrated on speciﬁc regions due to limited spatial coverage of ground-based observation stations. To overcome this spatial limitation, this study performs a spatial interpolation based on a machine learning method, random forest, to interpolate monthly {SSR} anomalies using a number of climatic variables (various temperature indices, cloud coverage, etc.), time-point indicators (years and months of {SSR} observations), and geographical characteristics of locations (latitude, longitude, etc.). The predictors that provide the largest explanatory power for interannual variability are diurnal temperature range and cloud coverage. The output of the spatial interpolation is a 0.58 3 0.58 monthly gridded dataset of {SSR} anomalies with complete land coverage over the period 1961–2019, which is used afterward in a comprehensive trend analysis for (i) each continent separately and (ii) the entire globe. The continental-level analysis reveals the major contributors to the global dimming and brightening. In particular, the global dimming before the 1980s is primarily dominated by negative trends in Asia and North America, whereas Europe and Oceania have been the two largest contributors to the brightening after 1982 and up until 2019.},

  abstract         = {This work presents evidence that ultraviolet ({UV})-A solar irradiances show increasing trends at Thessaloniki, Greece, where air quality has been improving because of air pollution abatement strategies. In contrast, over Beijing, China, where air quality measures were taken later, solar brightening was delayed. It is shown that until the early 1990s, {UV}-A irradiances over Thessaloniki show a downward trend of –0.5\% yr−1, which reverses sign and becomes positive in the last decade (+0.8\% yr−1). This brightening is related to a decreasing trend in local aerosol amounts. Both the negative rate of change (dimming) and the positive rate of change (brightening) are ampliﬁed in the {UV}-A solar irradiances, compared with the total solar irradiance, by a factor of 2.6. Satellite derived short-wave radiation over Beijing showed negative changes of –0.4\% (1984–1991) and –0.1\% yr−1 during 1994–2006. The negative trend in solar radiation continued even during 2000–2006. Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth ({AOD}) increased by +1.0\% yr−1 during 2000–2006, in agreement with in situ measurements of increasing {AOD}. Therefore, a statistically signiﬁcant change from dimming to brightening in Beijing could not be seen in the last decade, but it is expected to occur in the near future.},
