      Another author footnote, this is a very long footnote and it should be a really long footnote. But this footnote is not yet sufficiently long enough to make two lines of footnote text.

# Intro




# Data and methodology


Data with quality control


Clear sky identification
- helps on determining thresholds


Criteria for enhancement based on TSI
- some other were tested

Thresholds by inspecting a selection of days with some specs



# Results

- max
- seasonal
- trends
- duration
- occurrence
- SZA

# Bibliography styles

Here are two sample references: @Feynman1963118 @Dirac1953888.

By default, natbib will be used with the `authoryear` style, set in `classoption` variable in YAML. You can sets extra options with `natbiboptions` variable in YAML header. Example

```         
natbiboptions: longnamesfirst,angle,semicolon
```

There are various more specific bibliography styles available at <https://support.stmdocs.in/wiki/index.php?title=Model-wise_bibliographic_style_files>. To use one of these, add it in the header using, for example, `biblio-style: model1-num-names`.

## Using CSL

If `cite-method` is set to `citeproc` in `elsevier_article()`, then pandoc is used for citations instead of `natbib`. In this case, the `csl` option is used to format the references. By default, this template will provide an appropriate style, but alternative `csl` files are available from <https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=elsevier>. These can be downloaded and stored locally, or the url can be used as in the example header.

# Equations

Here is an equation: $$ 
  f_{X}(x) = \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right)
  \left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha-1}
  e^{-\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha}}; 
  \alpha,\beta,x > 0 .
$$ {#eq-lowbap}

Inline equations work as well: $\sum_{i = 2}^\infty\{\alpha_i^\beta\}$

# Figures and tables

@fig-meaningless is generated using an R chunk.

```{r}
#| label: fig-meaningless
#| fig-cap: A meaningless scatterplot
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
#| echo: false
plot(runif(25), runif(25))
```

# Tables coming from R

Tables can also be generated using R chunks, as shown in @tbl-simple example.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-simple
#| tbl-cap: Caption centered above table
#| echo: true
knitr::kable(head(mtcars)[,1:4])
```
