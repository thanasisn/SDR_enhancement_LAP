CE mechanism

In this study, we define as cloud enhancement events (CE) the cases when the measured
global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at ground level, exceeds the expected value under
clear-sky conditions.
Similar, we define the extreme cloud enhancement events (ECE), the cases when GHI,
exceeds the Total Solar Irradiance on horizontal plane at ground level.
Although the duration of these bursts varies from instantaneous to several minutes,
here we are constrained by the recorded data, to one-minute steps.

Many have used models or some statistical method to determine then CE thresholds.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of the clouds on the total downward radiation
by studding the occurrences of the cloud enhancement cases, their intensity, and their
duration. The recording of the radiation signal is the mean of one-minute. Thus, we
will refer to this time step as a cloud enhancement event (CE).

\section{Data and methodology}\label{data-and-methodology}}

\hypertarget{ghi-data}{%
\subsection{GHI data}\label{ghi-data}}

The monitoring site is operating in the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics of the
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (\(40^\circ\,38'\,\)N,
\(22^\circ\,57'\,\)E, \(80\,\)m~a.s.l.).
In this study we present data from the period
13~April 1993 to
31~December 2023.
The GHI data were measured with a Kipp~\& Zonen CM-21 pyranometer. During the study
period, the pyranometer was independently calibrated three times at the
Meteorologisches Observatorium Lindenberg, DWD, verifying that the stability of the
instrument's sensitivity was better than \(0.7\%\) relative to the initial calibration
by the manufacturer.
For the acquisition of radiometric data, the signal of the pyranometer was sampled at
a rate of \(1\,\text{Hz}\). The mean and the standard deviation of these samples were
calculated and recorded for every minute. The measurements were corrected for the
zero offset (``dark signal'' in volts), which was calculated by averaging all
measurements recorded for a period of \(3\,\text{h}\), before (morning) or after
(evening) the Sun reaches an elevation angle of \(-10^\circ\). The signal was
converted to irradiance using the ramped value of the instrument's sensitivity
between subsequent calibrations.

To further improve the quality of the irradiance data, a manual screening was
performed to remove inconsistent and erroneous recordings that can occur
stochastically or systematically during the continuous operation of the instruments.
The manual screening was aided by a radiation data quality assurance procedure,
adjusted for the site, which was based on the methods of Long and Shi~(Long and Shi 2006, 2008). Thus, problematic recordings have been excluded from further
processing. Although it is impossible to detect all false data, the large number of
available data, and the aggregation scheme we used, ensures the quality of the
radiation measurements used in this study.
To preserve an unbiased representation of the data we applied a constraint, similar
the one used by Castillejo-Cuberos and Escobar (2020). Where, for each valid hour of day, there must
exist at least 45 minutes of valid measurements, including nighttime near sunrise and
sunset. Days with less than 5 valid hours are rejected completely.
Furthermore, due to the significant measurement uncertainty when the Sun is near the
horizon, and due to some systematic obstructions by nearby buildings, we have
excluded all measurements with solar zenith angle (SZA) greater than
\(78^\circ\).

\hypertarget{cloud-enhancement-detection}{%
\subsection{Cloud enhancement detection}\label{cloud-enhancement-detection}}

To be able to detect the CE cases, we had to establish a baseline, above which we can
characterize each data point as an enhancement event, by estimating the occurring
over irradiance (OI). To have an estimation and a first insight on the phenomenon,
we experimented with two simple approaches for the reference. The Haurwitz's model
(Haurwitz 1945), which is as simple clear sky model, and we had already adjusted and
had good fit with our data (Natsis, Bais, and Meleti 2023), and the TSI at the top of the atmosphere.
We have tested both cases by using an appropriate relative threshold and/or an
additional constant offset. The initial results, showed that we can detect a big
portion of the CE events. These results were helpful, and helped to establish some
criteria to further improve the CE identification. It was evident, by inspecting the
daily plot of irradiance, that changes on the atmospheric conditions introduced
numerous false positive and false negative results. To produce a more accurate
reference, we had to take into account more factors that effect the clear sky
radiation. So we used a radiation transfer model.

\hypertarget{modeled-clear-sky-irradiance}{%
\subsection{Modeled clear Sky Irradiance}\label{modeled-clear-sky-irradiance}}

We approximated the expected clear sky GHI by using a model. Because of the lack of
observational data for the whole period, we used some long term climatological data
for the main factors responsible for the attenuation of the broadband downward solar
radiation in the atmosphere. Which are mainly, the aerosols and the water vapors.
Fortunately, our site participates in the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)
(Giles et al. 2019; Buis et al. 1998), as we operate a Cimel photometer since 2003, collocated with
the CM-21 pyranometer. The mean monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD) on different
wavelengths is provided by AERONET, along with the equivalent water column height in
the atmosphere. The simulation of the clear sky radiation was performed by the well
established radiation transfer model Libradtran (Emde et al. 2016), a similar
approach, was also used by Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and Kazantzidis (2020) for creating a clear sky reference.

For completeness, we will describe here the main points of the radiation simulation
procedure. We used as input the spectrum of Kurucz (1994) in the range \(280\) to
\(2500\,\text{nm}\), with the Libradtran radiation transfer solver ``disort'' on a
``pseudospherical'' geometry and the ``LOWTRAN'' gas parameterization. For each
combination of conditions we use a SZA step of \(0.2^\circ\).
For the atmospheric characteristics, we iterated for combinations of AOD at
\(500\,\text{nm}\) (\(t_{500\text{nm}}\)) with additional offsets of \(\pm1\) and
\(\pm2\sigma\), and water column (\(w_h\)), also with offsets of \(\pm1\) and \(\pm2\sigma\).
We applied them on two atmospheric profiles, from the Air Force Geophysics
Laboratory (AFGL). The ``AFGL atmospheric constituent profile, midlatitude summer''
(afglms) and the ``AFG Latmospheric constituent profile, midlatitude winter'' (afglmw)
(Anderson et al. 1986).

To create a look up table that aligns with our dataset, we applied some adjustments.
To account for the Sun's variability in our one-minute GHI measurements, we corrected
the model's input spectrum integral, to the one of the total solar irradiance (TSI)
provided by NOAA (Coddington et al. 2005). Also, we applied the effect of the Earth -- Sun
distance on the irradiance, by using the distance calculated by the Astropy
(Astropy Collaboration et al. 2022) software library. As needed, we interpolate the resulting
irradiances to the exact SZA of our measurements. For each period of the year, we
used the appropriate atmospheric profile (afglms or afglmw). Finally, we calculated
the clear sky irradiance value at the horizontal plane. Thus, we were able to
emulate different atmospheric condition and levels of atmospheric clearness for the
climatological conditions of the site. With this method, the modeled clear sky
irradiances can be directly compared to each measured one-minute value of GHI, for
different conditions of atmospheric clearness.

by an empirica approach by inspecting a set of chosen days.

we adjusted teh threshold for each and chek then results

After evaluating the modeled clear radiation for the different atmospheric conditions,
in relation to the measured GHI data, we choose as a representative of the clear sky radiation,
the case with
\(t_{\text{cs}} = t_{500\text{nm}} - 1\sigma\) and \(w_{h\text{cs}} = w_h - 1\sigma\).

\end{itemize}

Of course, have to choose which atmospheric conditions qualify as a good clear sky analogous radiation.
This selection has some subjectivity, as the definition of clear sky, is in relation
of the intended usage. Our main focus is to be able to identify the OI created by the
clouds. Although, the aerosols and water vapor are always present and can not be
completely removed. The effect of the different clearness lavels

the effect of the sza uniform

These values will represent a typical atmosphere in
Thessaloniki with low load of aerosols and humidity, which are the main factor that
attenuate the GHI, excluding clouds.
We will refer to this irradiance as \(\text{GHI}_\text{mCSi}\).

The use of the actual modeled values of clear sky GHI can not provide us with a
robust method to distinguish the CE cases, due to the limited accuracy of the input
data. Our main focus was to positively identify over irradiance events from CEs,
thus we used a relative factor, to create an upper envelope of the clear sky
irradiance, above which, any GHI value can safely attributed to CE.

To select the exact values of the thresholds (Equation \ref{eq:CE4}), we implemented
manual inspection of the CE identification, on specially selected days from the whole
dataset. We used seven sets of selected days, with characteristics relevant to the
efficiency of the identification threshold. These sets were random groups of about
20 to 30 days with the following characteristics:
(a) the largest over irradiance CE events,
(b) the largest daily total over irradiance,
(c) without clouds (by implementing a clear sky identification algorithm as discussed in Natsis, Bais, and Meleti (2023)),
(d) without clouds and without EC events,
(e) with at least \(60\%\) of the day length without clouds and some EC events,
(h) random days and
(i) some manual selected days that were included during the manual inspection.

Where it was needed, for some of the edge cases, we also used images from a sky-cam,
along with the manual inspection.

Criteria for cloud enhancement identification are set according the Equation\nobreakspace\ref{eq:CE4}

\begin{equation}
\text{CE} : \begin{cases}
 \text{GHI}_\text{i} > 1.05 \cdot \text{GHI}_\text{mCSi}, & \text{$\theta \leq 60^\circ$}\\
\text{GHI}_\text{i} > \left ({ 1.18 + \frac{1.05 - 1.18}{60 - 78} \cdot (\theta- 78) } \right ) \cdot \text{GHI}_\text{mCSi}, & \text{$ 78^\circ > \theta > 60^\circ$}\\
\text{Excluded measurements}, & \theta > 78^\circ
\end{cases}\label{eq:CE4}
\end{equation}
where: \(\theta\) solar zenith angle.

A secondary criterion was used for extreme cloud enhancement cases (ECE)
identification, relative to the TSI at horizontal plane
(Equation\nobreakspace{}\ref{eq:ECE})

\begin{equation}
\text{ECE}: \text{GHI} > \cos(\theta) \times \text{TSI}_\text{TOA}

\section{Results}\label{results}}

Our dataset, after the data selection processing, consists of
6144534 records of GHI, of which
\(1.799\,\%\) are CE and
\(0.036\,\%\) are ECE events.
The highest GHI recorder was
\(1416.6\,W/m^2\)
on 24~May 2007.
The absolute stronger CE event had an over irradiance of
\(341.79\,W/m^2\) on
15~May 2014.
The relative stronger CE event was
\(54\,\%\) above the
clear sky threshold, on
28~October 2016.

\hypertarget{trends}{%
\subsection{Trends}\label{trends}}

We computed the daily trend of the mean over irradiance of CE
(Figure\nobreakspace{}\ref{fig:CEmeanDaily}), using a first-order autoregressive
model with lag of 1 day, using the `maximum likelihood' fitting method (Gardner, Harvey, and Phillips 1980; Jones 1980) by implementing the function `arima' from the library `stats' of the R
programming language (R Core Team 2023). The trends were reported together with the \(2\sigma\)
error. We observe an increase of
\(0.216\pm 0.083\,W/m^2\)
on the mean over irradiance.

\caption{Daily mean values and trend of the CE over irradiance.}\label{fig:CEmeanDaily}
\end{figure}

Although, the previous result is closer to the raw data, we preferred to present the
annual statistics, that give a more clear picture about the long term CE trends.
Hence, we calculated the annual values from the one-minute measurements.
The annual mean over irradiance is
\(0.23\pm 0.11\,W/m^2\)
(Figure\nobreakspace{}\ref{fig:P-energy-mean}),
but this value is not very useful due the high
variability of this metric.

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{../images/P_energy-7}

\caption{Trends of the mean over irradiance per CE.}\label{fig:P-energy-mean}
\end{figure}

A better indicator of changes on the characteristic of CE would be the number of CE
occurrences and the total energy of the CE over irradiance. The annual number of CE
occurrences, shows a steady increase of
\(122.2\pm 22.8\,/y\)
(Figure\nobreakspace{}\ref{fig:P-energy-N}).
We have to note that the energy related to the CE events can not be directly linked
with the total energy balance on the atmosphere. The net sun radiation of the region
is not increased, but rather redistributed through the CE.

Subsequently, the annual energy observed during CE events shows a annual increase of
\(341.6\pm 73.1\,kJ/y\)
(Figure~\ref{fig:P-energy-sum}), witch follows the trend of the number of
occurrences.

Another interesting aspect of the CE cases, is the seasonal cycle. In
Figure\nobreakspace{}\ref{fig:relative-month-occurancies}, we have the box plot
(whisker plot), where the values have been normalized by the highest median value,
that occurs in May. Although the number of occurrences has a wide spread throughout
the study period, the most active period of CE occurrences is during May and June.
During the Winter (December -- February) the CE cases are about 25\% of the maximum.
The rest of the months the occurrences seems to ramp between the maximum and minimum.

\end{figure}

The distribution of the CE over irradiance spreads uniformly
Figure\nobreakspace{}\ref{fig:ovir-distribution}. Where there is an inverse relation
between the events frequency and events intensity. This is expected as, the stronger
the CE events become, the more rare are the particular atmospheric and sun conditions
to occur.

In order to further study the characteristics of the CE events, we grouped the singe
minute CE events, to continuous CE groups (CEG). Thus, a CEG consists of one or more
successive CE cases, and can have a duration of multiple of minutes. We have
identified 29009 groups, where the group with the longest duration lasted
140 minutes on
07~July 2013.
By examining the frequency distribution of the CEG durations
(Figure\nobreakspace{}\ref{fig:ceg-duration-distribution}), we can conclude that longer durations are getting increasingly rare, with durations above 10 minutes very rare.
