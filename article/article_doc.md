  global solar irradiance at Thessaloniki, Greece
---

# Abstract

**Abstract temporary placed here for technical reasons**

In this study, we investigate the characteristics of global horizontal
irradiance enhancement events induced by clouds over Thessaloniki for
the period 1994 -- 2023 using data recorded every one minute. We
identified the cloud enhancement (CE) events by creating an appropriate
cloud-free irradiance reference using a radiative transfer model and
aerosol optical depth data from a collocated Cimel sun photometer and a
Brewer spectrophotometer. We found a trend in CE events of
$+ 112 \pm 35\,\text{cases}/\text{year}$, and a trend in the
corresponding irradiation of $+ 329.9 \pm 112\,\text{kJ}/\text{year}$.
The peak of the CE events was observed during May and June. CE events
with duration longer than 10min are very rare ($< 8\,\%$), with
exceptions lasting over an hour and up to 140 minutes. Finally, we have
detected enhancements above the total solar irradiance at the top of the
atmosphere for the same solar zenith angle of up to
$204\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$, with the $75\,\%$ of the cases below
$40\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. Most of these extreme events occur in
spring -- early summer, with a secondary peak in autumn.

# 1 Introduction

The shortwave solar radiation, reaching Earth's surface, is the main
energy source for the atmosphere and the biosphere, and drives and
governs the climate (Gray et al. 2010). It has direct practical
application in industries related to energy and agricultural production.
The variability of its intensity can impose difficulties in predicting
the yield and in designing the specifications of the appropriate
equipment. A significant portion of the relevant research has been
focused on predicting the renewable energy production in a fine
timescale and in near real-time (for a review see Inman, Pedro, and
Coimbra 2013; Graabak and Korpås 2016).

An important aspect of the variability of solar radiation is its
interaction with the clouds. In general, clouds can attenuate a fraction
of solar irradiance, but under certain conditions, can lead to
enhancement of the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) reaching the
ground. This cloud enhancement (CE) effect can locally increase the
observed GHI to levels even higher than the expected cloud-free
irradiance \[Cordero et al. (2023); Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and
Kazantzidis (2020); Castillejo-Cuberos and Escobar (2020); and
references therein\].

Some of the proposed underling mechanisms of those enhancements have
been summarized by Gueymard (2017); the most important being the
scattering of radiation on the edges of cumulus clouds. It has also been
suggested that enhancement of GHI can be produced by thin cirrus clouds
though refraction and scattering (Thuillier et al. 2013). Further
investigation with radiative transfer modeling and observations pointed
as the prevailing mechanism, the strong forward Mie scattering through
clouds of low optical depth (Pecenak et al. 2016; Thuillier et al. 2013;
G. H. Yordanov et al. 2013; Georgi Hristov Yordanov, Saetre, and
Midtgård 2015). Overall, the appearance of CE events depend on different
interactive factors, which include cloud thickness, structure and type,
and the relative position of the sun and the clouds (Gueymard 2017;
Veerman, Van Stratum, and Van Heerwaarden 2022).

On multiple sites, cloud enhancements have been reported that exceed
momentarily the solar constant, resulting in clearness indices above
unit. A summary of extreme cloud enhancement (ECE) cases has been
compiled by Martins, Mantelli, and Rüther (2022). Cloud enhancements can
have also some practical implications. The intensity and duration of
enhancements can affect the efficiency and stability of photovoltaic
power production (Lappalainen and Kleissl 2020; Järvelä and Valkealahti
2020), while ECEs have the potential to compromise the integrity of
photovoltaic plants infrastructure (Do Nascimento et al. 2019). It has
also been demonstrated that these events can interfere in the comparison
of ground-based and satellite observations of radiation (Damiani et al.
2018). Global warming has likely affected cloud coverage in the last few
decades. Liu et al. (2023) reported increases in cloud cover over the
tropical and subtropical oceans and decreases over most continents,
while Dong, Sutton, and Wilcox (2023) reported decreases over North
America and Europe. To our knowledge, there is no evidence of whether
this trend has affected also the number and strength of CE events.

Methods of identification of CE events usually include the use of
simulated cloud-free irradiance as baseline, combined with an
appropriate threshold or some other statistical characteristics, and in
some cases, with visual inspection of sky camera images (Vamvakas,
Salamalikis, and Kazantzidis 2020; Mol, Knap, and Van Heerwaarden 2023
and references therein).

In this study, we evaluate the effects of CE events on GHI by
investigating their frequency of occurrence, intensity, and duration in
a thirty-year record of GHI observations at Thessaloniki, Greece. We
used modeled cloud-free irradiance as a baseline to identify cloud
enhancements, and we determined long-term trends of the above-mentioned
metrics, their climatology and some general characteristics. To our
knowledge, there are no other studies that provide trends from such a
long dataset.

# 2 Data and methodology

## 2.1 Instrumentation and data

The data used in this study were recorded at the monitoring site of the
Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,
in Thessaloniki, Greece ($40^{\circ}\, 38\prime\,$N,
$22^{\circ}\, 57\prime\,$E, $80\,$m a.s.l.). The GHI data were measured
with a Kipp & Zonen CM-21 pyranometer and cover the period 01 January
1994 to 31 December 2023. During the study period, the pyranometer was
independently calibrated three times at the Meteorologisches
Observatorium Lindenberg, DWD, verifying that the stability of the
instrument's sensitivity was better than $0.7\,\%$ relative to the
initial calibration by the manufacturer. For the acquisition of
radiometric data, the signal of the pyranometer was sampled at a rate of
$1\,\text{Hz}$ with the mean and standard deviation of these samples
calculated and recorded every minute. The measurements were corrected
for the zero offset ("dark signal" in volts), which was calculated by
averaging all measurements recorded for a period of $3\,\text{h}$,
before (morning) or after (evening) the Sun reaches an elevation angle
of $- 10^{\circ}$. The signal was converted to irradiance using the
ramped value of the instrument's sensitivity between subsequent
calibrations. We note that the specific model of the pyranometer is not
capable in recording the instrument's temperature, therefore any
temperature changes that may occur during the day (including those due
to sudden increases or decreases in incidence irradiance) were not
considered in the data reduction procedure. However, the sensitivity of
the instrument to temperature is less than $\pm 1\,\%$ for its
operational range ($- 20^{\circ}$ -- $50^{\circ}$C).

To further improve the quality of the irradiance data, a manual
screening was performed, to remove inconsistent and erroneous recordings
that can occur stochastically or systematically during the long
operation of the instrument. The manual screening was aided by a
radiation data quality assurance procedure, adjusted for the site, which
was based on the methods of Long and Shi (Long and Shi 2006, 2008).
Thus, problematic recordings have been excluded from further processing.
Furthermore, due to the significant measurement uncertainty in GHI when
the Sun is near the horizon, and due to some systematic obstructions by
nearby buildings, we have excluded all measurements with solar zenith
angle (SZA) greater than $78^{\circ}$. Finally, images from a sky camera
have been used in the manual inspection of the CE identification. The
sky camera has been operating since 2012 and stores images in 5 min time
steps. An overview of the GHI data used in this study is given in
Figure, as the daily means. Daily means were calculated only for days
with at least $60\,\%$ of data availability; however, all available
one-minute measurements have been used for the detection of CE events.

the period 1994 -- 2023.

## 2.2 Cloud enhancement detection

In this study, we define an event as CE when the measured GHI at ground
level exceeds the expected value under cloud-free conditions. Similarly,
we define as extreme cloud enhancement events (ECE), the cases when GHI
at ground level exceeds the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) at the top of
the atmosphere (TOA) for the same SZA. Although the duration of these
bursts can vary from seconds to several minutes, here we are constrained
by the temporal resolution of our data to identify events with a
duration of at minimum one-minute.

For the detection of CE cases, we established a baseline of irradiance
above which we characterized each data point as an enhancement event and
calculated the over irradiance (OI). The OI is defined as the irradiance
difference of the measured one-minute GHI from the
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ corresponding to cloud-free atmosphere. First,
we used a simple approach for the determination of
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$: The Haurwitz's model (Haurwitz 1945), which
is a simple clear sky radiation model and was already adjusted and
applied to our data (Natsis, Bais, and Meleti 2023). We created a
threshold by using an appropriate relative and/or an additional constant
offset. The initial results showed that we can detect a big portion of
the actual CE events. However, by inspecting the daily plots of
irradiance, it became evident that changes in atmospheric conditions
introduced numerous false positive or false negative results. The main
reason for these discrepancies is the variability of the effects of
aerosols and water vapor which were not considered in the simple method.
To produce a more representative reference we included the effects of
these factors using a radiative transfer model (RTM). The applied
methodology is discussed in section.

## 2.3 Modeled cloud-free Irradiance

### 2.3.1 Climatology of cloud-free irradiance

We approximated the expected cloud-free $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ with
the radiative transfer model uvspec, part of libRadtran (Emde et al.
2016), similarly to the approach used by Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and
Kazantzidis (2020). In uvspec we used the solar spectrum of Kurucz
(1994) in the range $280$ to $2500\,\text{nm}$, the radiative transfer
solver "disort" in "pseudospherical" geometry and the "LOWTRAN" gas
parameterization. The model was run for climatological values of the
Angstrom coefficients, water column (WC), SZA and the appropriate
seasonal atmospheric profile to create a look-up table (LUT) for the
estimation of the cloud-free reference irradiance for each individual
observation of our dataset. In this context, the model was run for SZAs
in the range $10$ -- $90^{\circ}$ with a step of ${0.2}^{\circ}$ and for
the atmospheric profiles of the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory
(Anderson et al. 1986) midlatitude summer and midlatitude winter,
representative of the warm and cold seasons.

Main factors responsible for the attenuation of the broadband downward
solar radiation under cloud free atmospheres are aerosols and water
vapor. At Thessaloniki, such measurements are available since 2003 from
a Cimel sun photometer, which is part of the Aerosol Robotic Network
(AERONET) (Giles et al. 2019; Buis et al. 1998). From the observations
in the period 2003 -- 2023 we calculated the monthly climatological
means and standard deviation ($\sigma$) for the aerosol optical depth
(AOD) at $500\,\text{nm}$ and the equivalent height of the water column
(WC). The monthly climatological values of AOD and WC, as well as
combinations with additional offsets of $\pm 1\sigma$ and $\pm 2\sigma$,
were used as inputs to the RTM in the construction of the LUT.

For each measurement of the dataset, we calculated from the LUT a
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ value for the respective season and SZA (by
linear interpolation), and for the climatological values of AOD and WC
of the respective month. The same procedure was followed for the
estimation of the $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ for all combinations of the
AOD and WC with the above-mentioned standard deviation offsets. Finally,
each $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ value was adjusted to the actual
Sun-Earth distance derived by the Astropy software library (Astropy
Collaboration et al. 2022).

### 2.3.2 Long-term change of cloud-free irradiance

The cloud-free reference values discussed above are based on the
climatological AOD and WC; hence they cannot describe accurately the
long-term variation of $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ due to long-term
changes in the two atmospheric constituents, mainly AOD. As reported by
Natsis, Bais, and Meleti (2023), there is a long-term brightening effect
in the GHI data of Thessaloniki for the period 1993 -- 2023, which for
cloud-free data was attributed to long-term changes in aerosol effects.
Therefore, an adjustment of the $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ during the
period of study was made using RTM simulations to account for the
long-term variations of the AOD. High quality AOD data with a Cimel
sun-photometer (part of AERONET) at Thessaloniki start only in 2003,
while spectral AOD measurements using direct-sun observations with a
MKIII Brewer spectrophotometer are available for the period 1997 --
2017. These data are taken sporadically during each day and are less
dense compared to the AERONET data. By comparing monthly AOD data at
$340\,\text{nm}$ of the two instruments for the common periods of
operation we adjusted the Brewer data and filled the missing months of
the Cimel record data with Brewer data. Using the monthly time series of
AOD at $340\,\text{nm}$, as well as monthly climatological values of the
Ångström exponent and constant WC of $15.6\,\text{mm}$ derived from the
Cimel record, we simulated with the RTM the cloud-free GHI at SZA of
$55^{\circ}$ for each month in the period 1997 -- 2023. The SZA of
$55^{\circ}$ was chosen as representative of all days in the year to get
a rough estimate of the annually averaged change in cloud-free GHI. A
second-degree polynomial fit was applied to the simulated yearly
averaged GHI to derive the long-term change in GHI due to aerosols:

$$\Delta\left( \text{AOD} \right)\lbrack\%\rbrack = - 12170 + 12.05 \cdot y + - 0.002981 \cdot y^{2}$$

where $y$ is the date as a decimal fraction of the year. For the period
of the study the relative change of AOD ranges between $- 1.88$ and
$- 0.23\,\%$. Finally, we applied these long-term changes of Equation to
the climatological $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$, to create a more realistic
representation of the cloud-free irradiance for the entire period of
study. For the period 1994 -- 1996 where no AOD data are available, we
assumed that the changes in GHI follow the same polynomial fit.

## 2.4 Criteria for the identification of CE events

One of the goals of this study was to quantify the OI related to CEs. A
key issue for achieving this goal is to define a threshold for the CE
identification, representative of the cloud-free irradiance at the time
of each GHI measurement. This depends on the selection of the
appropriate atmospheric parameterization for the RTM simulations. The
implementation of the long-term change in AOD, discussed in section,
allows capturing a large part of the natural variability of cloud-free
GHI. However, the short-term variability of AOD cannot be taken
adequately into account when using monthly values in the model
simulations. We tried different approaches to strengthen the robustness
of the methodology and to compensate for the limited accuracy of the RTM
input data and the unpredictable natural variability of the atmosphere.

First, we evaluated the performance of the modelled
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ in relation to the measured GHI for different
levels of atmospheric clearness, by using in the RTM the monthly
climatological AOD and WC, less their respective standard deviations.
These values represent typical atmospheres in Thessaloniki with lower
than average load of aerosols and humidity, which are the main factors
that attenuate the GHI, excluding clouds. With this approach, the
simulated $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ should be generally greater than the
measured GHI when aerosols are more abundant. The correlation of the
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ with the GHI was tested for a subset of
cloud-free days with more than $80\,\%$ data availability (Figure) and
found to have a positive bias of more than $18\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$
across all levels of radiation. To achieve a robust and clear
distinction of CE cases, we set the criteria of CE detection
$25\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$ above the $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$.

![Figure 2.2: The corelation GHI with \\text{GHI}\_\\text{ref}, for
cloud-free data of days with data availability more than
80\\,\\%.](media/rId31.png){width="5.833333333333333in"

Figure 2.2: The corelation GHI with $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$, for
cloud-free data of days with data availability more than $80\,\%$.

To further ensure the effectiveness of this CE criterion, we implement a
manual inspection of the CE identification results on selected days of
the whole dataset. We tested seven sets of days with different
characteristics relevant to the efficiency of the identification
threshold. These sets were random groups of about 20 -- 30 days with the
following characteristics: (a) the strongest OI CE events, (b) the
largest daily total OI, (c) absence of clouds (by implementing a cloud
identification algorithm as discussed in Natsis, Bais, and Meleti
(2023)), (d) absence of clouds and absence of CE events, (e) with at
least $60\,\%$ of the day length without clouds and presence of CE
events, (h) randomly selected days, and (i) manually selected days. For
the latter case and where needed, we also used images from the
sky-camera to further aid the decision of the manual inspection.

The definition of the CE events with this method has a degree of
subjectivity, since the actual cloud-free irradiance is not known and
can only be approximated. However, this method was proven capable in
detecting all major CE events. Where some CE events with very low OI may
be not detected, these are few with small over-irradiance, and it is
unlikely that will affect significantly our results.

A sub-category of the CE events that is often discussed in the
literature (Cordero et al. 2023; Martins, Mantelli, and Rüther 2022;
Georgi Hristov Yordanov, Saetre, and Midtgård 2015), are the extreme
cloud enhancement (ECE) events. These are cases of CE where the measured
intensity of the irradiance exceeds the TSI on horizontal plane at TOA.
In this case the threshold $E$ is given by:

$$\text{ECE}:E > \cos\left( \text{SZA} \right) \cdot E_{\odot}\frac{r_{\text{m}}^{2}}{r^{2}}$$

where: $\text{SZA}$ the solar zenith angle, $E_{\odot}$ is the solar
constant at the mean Sun -- Earth distance
($1367\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$), $r$ is the actual Sun - Earth distance
and $r_{\text{m}}$ is the mean Sun -- Earth distance of
$1.496 \times 10^{8}\,\text{km}$.

An example of the identification of CE events for a selected day is
given in the Figure, where the daily course of the cloud-free reference
irradiance and the CE and ECE thresholds are shown along with the actual
GHI measurements. The GHI data in the periods 7:30 -- 8:30 and after
14:00 are very close to the modeled cloud-free GHI (light blue line)
thus were identified as cloud-free instances. There is some ambiguity
for the data points laying between the CE threshold and the cloud-free
irradiance, which are not identified as CE events. These data points
correspond to cases either with AOD below the one assumed in the model,
or with very small OI.

In addition, we provide in Figure an example scatter plot between the
measured GHI and the modeled cloud-free irradiance for one year (2005),
where the CE and ECE events are clearly grouped above the cloud-free
irradiance (approximated with the green line). The grey colored data
points above this line correspond to the ambiguous data points discussed
above. Finally, the black belt just below the green line is formed from
data measured mainly under cloud-free conditions,conditions with the
spread likely caused by the short-term variability of AOD. A small
fraction of these data corresponds also to cases with thin cirrus clouds
causing weak attenuation of GHI, often indistinguishable from the
attenuation by aerosols.

# 3 Results

Following the application of the above discussed methodology to the
entire dataset ($6$ million of one-minute GHI measurements), $2.32\,\%$
were identified as CE events and $0.036\,\%$ as ECE events. The highest
recorded GHI due to CE was $1416.6\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$ on 24 May
2007 at a SZA of ${19.9}^{\circ}$ corresponding to OI of
$369.3\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$ or $35.3\,\%$ above the threshold. The
strongest CE event of $53\,\%$ above the cloud-free threshold was
observed on 28 October 2016 at a SZA of ${59.2}^{\circ}$ with a GHI
value of $861.8\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$ and a OI of
$298.4\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. Both cases are also ECE events with
$131.2\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$ and $161.5\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$ above
the TSI at TOA for the same SZA, respectively. In the following sections
we are discussing the long-term trends and variability of the CE events
as well as of the corresponding OI and excess irradiation.

## 3.1 Long-term trends

One aspect of this study is to investigate the time evolution of the CE
events by analyzing the GHI measurements at Thessaloniki. Cloud
enhancements can be influenced by different factors, such as the
geometry, size and optical thickness of clouds, their height in the
atmosphere and local weather regimes (Mol, Knap, and Van Heerwaarden
2023; Veerman, Van Stratum, and Van Heerwaarden 2022; Gristey et al.
2022; Tzoumanikas et al. 2016). Some of these factors are related to
changes in climate; hence it would be reasonable to expect contributing
to the frequency of occurrence of CE events over Thessaloniki, as well
as to the average OI and excess irradiation. The long-term trends were
calculated using a first-order autoregressive model with the 'maximum
likelihood' fitting method (Gardner, Harvey, and Phillips 1980; Jones
1980), by implementing the function 'arima' from the library 'stats' of
the R programming language (R Core Team 2023). All trends are reported
together with their $2\sigma$ error.

Figure shows the time series of the yearly number of CE cases (each with
duration of one minute), the yearly mean OI and the yearly excess
irradiation for the period 1994 -- 2023, together with corresponding
linear trends. To account for missing data, all three quantities have
been divided with the fraction of the valid GHI observations in each
month. Statistically significant (at the $95\,\%$ confidence level)
increasing trends appear for the yearly number of CE events
($+ 112 \pm 35\,\text{cases}/\text{year}$) and the excess irradiation
($+ 329.9 \pm 112\,\text{kJ}/\text{year}$), while the the trend in the
yearly mean OI is negligible
($+ 0.11 \pm 0.2\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}/\text{year}$) and of no
statistical significance. The average OI for the entire period is
$+ 42.6 \pm 2.8\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. The yearly excess irradiation
due to CE events ranges between about $8$ and
$24\,\text{MJ}/\text{m}^{2}$. On average, it is about one half of the
highest daily irradiation of \~31 MJ/m^2^ under cloud-free conditions
recorded at the summer solstice in Thessaloniki. Therefore, from solar
energy perspective the yearly excess irradiation is only a tiny fraction
of the available solar energy. Although the interannual variability of
the mean OI is rather weak, the variability about the trend lines is
quite large for the number of CE cases and the excess irradiation
(panels b and c). For these two quantities the spread tends to increase
with time, suggesting a significant variability in cloud patterns over
the area, possibly associated to changes in climate.

The interannual variability of the data about the trend lines is quite
large. Furthermore, the spread tends to increase with time (at least for
the quantities of panels b and c), suggesting a significant variability
in cloud patterns over the area, possibly associated to changes in
climate.

We have to note that the excess irradiation related to the CE events
cannot be directly linked to the total energy balance of the atmosphere.
The net solar radiation of the region is not increased, but is rather
redistributed through the CE events. This is also depicted by the ECE
irradiance values, which exceed the equivalent cloud-free irradiance by
a significant amount.

## 3.2 Climatology of cloud enhancement events

Next, we investigated the distribution of the CE events within the year.
Figure shows the monthly box and whisker plot of the CE number of
occurrences normalized with the highest median value, which occurs in
June, depicting a clear seasonal cycle. Although CE events are present
throughout the year, the most active months are May and June. During the
winter (December -- February), the number of CE cases is about $25\,\%$
of the maximum, while in the intermediate months, the number of
occurrences gradually ramps between the maximum and minimum. This
seasonality is a combined effect of different factors, among them the
types of clouds, their frequency of occurrence, the seasonally varying
relative position of the sun, as well as the local landscape
characteristics that may influence the formation of the clouds.
Unfortunately, lack of detailed data on cloud formation, type and
location is not allowing further analysis. The interannual variability
of the monthly CE events is quite high as manifested by the large
monthly extremes, especially in the summer.

values.](media/rId46.png){width="5.833333333333333in"

Figure 3.1: Seasonal variability of the number of CE events relative to
the corresponding number of GHI measurements in Thessaloniki for the
period 1994 -- 2023, in the form of a box and whisker plot. The box
contains the data between the lower $25\,\%$ and the upper $75\,\%$
percentiles, the thick horizontal line and the diamond symbol represent
the median and the mean values, respectively. The vertical lines
(whiskers) extend between the maximum and minimum monthly values.

The distribution of the number of CE events as a function of OI is shown
in Figure. There is an inverse relationship between the frequency of CE
events and OI with an exponential-like decline. This is expected, as the
stronger the CE events are, the rarer the conditions favoring the
occurrence of CE events. For the majority (over $62\,\%$) of the CE
events the OI is below the long-term average of
$42.6\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$, while about $8.1\,\%$ of the events
correspond to OI larger than $100\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$ and up to the
highest value of $412.4\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. This distribution is
indicative of the magnitude and the probability of the expected CE
events over Thessaloniki. Similar distribution of CE events, albeit with
larger OI values, has been reported by Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and
Kazantzidis (2020), for the city of Patras. This site is located
${2.5}^{\circ}$ south of Thessaloniki and is exposed to air masses
coming mainly from the eastern Mediterranean resulting in different
cloud patterns, that may affect the characteristics and magnitude of the
CE events.

## 3.3 Duration of cloud enhancement events

The duration of the CE events is variable and can last for several
minutes or even more than an hour. In order to study the characteristics
of these consecutive events, we grouped them into bins of increasing
duration in steps of one minute. We have identified 34849 groups of CE
in the whole period of study, where the group of the longest duration of
140 minutes occurred on 07 July 2013 in a SZA range of ${52.1}^{\circ}$
-- ${77.9}^{\circ}$. Figure shows the frequency distribution of the CE
events according to their duration. We conclude that although some
groups of events last for more than an hour, about $80\,\%$ have
duration of less than 5 minutes.

scales for better readability.

The relation between the duration and the mean OI of the groups has also
been studied (Figure). Evidently, events of high excess irradiation have
small duration and vice versa. The vast majority of grouped events are
associated with small excess irradiation ($< 5\,\text{kJ}/\text{m}^{2}$)
and small duration ($< 5\,\text{min}$). For example the extra energy
flux of $5\,\text{kJ}/\text{m}^{2}$ for $5\,\text{min}$ is equivalent to
OI of $\sim 17\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$ for the same duration. While
groups with strong excess irradiation and long duration are very rare.
Similar results of this relation have been reported by Zhang et al.
(2018) in a study using a far higher sampling rate ($100\,\text{Hz}$)
than ours.

## 3.4 Extreme cloud enhancement events

An aspect of the CE events that is commonly reported and has some
significance on the solar energy production infrastructure are the
extreme CE events (ECE), where solar irradiance exceeds the expected
irradiance on top of the atmosphere at the same SZA (Equation).
Analogous to Figure we have computed the distribution of the number of
occurrences of ECE events by month in Figure. The most active period for
ECE events is in spring and early summer (March -- June), followed by a
period in early autumn (September and October). This is probably related
to the weather characteristics in these periods, with frequent
alternations between cloud-free periods and clouds.

values.](media/rId64.png){width="5.833333333333333in"

the the corresponding number of GHI measurements in Thessaloniki for the
period 1994 -- 2023, in the form of a box and whisker plot. The box

percentiles. The thick horizontal line and the diamond symbol represent
the median and the mean values, respectively. The vertical lines
(whiskers) extend between the maximum and minimum monthly values.

The distribution of the ECE events (Figure) shows that in rare cases the
OI can exceed the TSI at TOA for the same SZA even by more than
$400\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$, while in $75\,\%$ of the cases the OI is
below $200\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. The OI for the most frequent ECEs
ranges between $140$ and $180\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. These findings
are in accordance with the results of Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and
Kazantzidis (2020), the only difference being that the OI values
reported for are higher than those for Thessaloniki.

# 4 Conclusions

By creating a cloud-free approximation representing the long- and
short-term variability of the expected cloud-free GHI, we were able to
identify cases of CE events in Thessaloniki for the period 1994 -- 2023.
After analyzing the CE cases, we found an increase of
$+ 112.1 \pm 34.9\,\text{cases}/\text{year}$, with the mean annual
irradiation of the CE events increasing with a rate of
$+ 329.9 \pm 112\,\text{kJ}/\text{year}$. The most active months of CE
events are May and June. We found that continuous CE events can last up
to $140$ minutes, while the duration of $80\,\%$ of them is bellow $5$
minutes.

We have observed ECE cases exceeding the TSI by
$400\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$ with $75\,\%$ of the cases under
$200\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. The climatological characteristics of the
ECE events showed that the most active months are spread in half of the
year and particularly in the periods March -- June and September --
October. The magnitude of the ECE events identified in Thessaloniki
events does not exceed the values reported for sites with more
favourable conditions for the phenomenon (e.g., Cordero et al. 2023).
Some of the characteristics of CE and ECE events we analyzed have strong
similarities with the results of Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and Kazantzidis
(2020) for the city of Patras, south of Thessaloniki, albeit with
differences in the magnitude of OI.

An interpretation of the CE trends shows that the interaction of GHI
with the clouds, through this 30-year period, is a dynamic phenomenon
that needs further investigation. For such studies it would be essential
to have more detailed information on cloud characteristics, especially
in order to investigate possible associations of the observed trends
with changes in climate.
