title: Long-term cloud enhancement events of global solar irradiance
  over Thessaloniki, Greece
---

# Abstract

We studied the enhancement of the global horizontal irradiance induced
by clouds over Thessaloniki for the period 1993 -- 2023 using data
recorded every one minute. We identified the cloud enhancement events
(CE) by creating an appropriate clear sky irradiance reference with the
use of a radiative transfer model and aerosol optical depth data from a
collocated Cimel sun photometer and a Brewer spectrophotometer. We found
a trend in CE events of $45.6 \pm 21.9\,\text{cases}/\text{year}$, and a
trend in the CE events irradiation of
$116.9 \pm 67.8\,\text{kJ}/\text{year}$. The peak of the CE events was
observed during May and June. An analysis of the total duration of CE
events, showed that durations longer than 5 minutes are very rare, with
exceptions lasting over an hour. Finally we have detected enhancements
above the total solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere of up to
$400\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$, with the $75\,\%$ of the cases below
$200\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$.

# 1 Introduction

The shortwave solar radiation, reaching Earth's surface, is the main
energy source of the atmosphere and the biosphere, and drives and
governs the climate (Gray et al. 2010). It has direct practical
application in industries like energy and agricultural production. The
variability of its intensity can impose difficulties in predicting the
yield and in designing the specifications of the appropriate equipment.
Significant portion of research has been focused on predicting the
renewable energy production in a fine timescale and in near real-time
(for a review see Inman, Pedro, and Coimbra (2013); Graabak and Korpås
(2016)).

An important aspect of the variability of solar radiation is its
interaction with the clouds. In general, clouds can attenuate a fraction
of solar irradiance, but under certain conditions, can lead to
enhancement of the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) reaching the
ground. This cloud enhancement (CE) effect can locally increase the
observed GHI to levels even higher than the expected clear-sky
irradiance (Cordero et al. 2023; Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and Kazantzidis
2020; Castillejo-Cuberos and Escobar 2020; Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and
Kazantzidis 2020 and references therein).

Some of the proposed underling mechanisms of those enhancements, have
been summarized by Gueymard (2017); the most important being the
scattering of radiation on the edges of cumulus clouds. It has been also
suggested that enhancement of GHI can be produced by thin cirrus clouds
though refraction and scattering (Thuillier et al. 2013). Further
investigation with radiative transfer modeling and observations pointed
as the prevailing mechanism, the strong forward Mie scattering through
clouds of low optical depth (Pecenak et al. 2016; Thuillier et al. 2013;
G. H. Yordanov et al. 2013; Georgi Hristov Yordanov, Saetre, and
Midtgård 2015). Overall, enhancement events depend on different
interactive factors, which include cloud thickness, structure and type,
and the relative position of the sun and the clouds (Gueymard 2017;
Veerman, Van Stratum, and Van Heerwaarden 2022).

On multiple sites, cloud enhancements have been reported that exceed
momentarily the solar constant, resulting in clearness indices above
unit. A summary of extreme cloud enchantment (ECE) cases has been
compiled by Martins, Mantelli, and Rüther (2022). Cloud enhancements can
have also some practical implications. The intensity and duration of
enhancements can effect the efficiency and stability of photovoltaic
power production (Lappalainen and Kleissl 2020; Järvelä and Valkealahti
2020) while ECEs have the potential to compromise the integrity of
photovoltaic plants infrastructure (Do Nascimento et al. 2019). It has
also been demonstrated that these events can interfere in the comparison
of ground-based and satellite observations (Damiani et al. 2018). Global
warming has likely affected cloud coverage in the last few decades. Liu
et al. (2023) reported increases in cloud cover over the tropical and
subtropical oceans and decreases over most continents, while Dong,
Sutton, and Wilcox (2023) reported decreases over North America and
Europe. To our knowledge, there is no evidence on whether this trend has
affected also the number and strength of CE events.

Methods of identification of CE events usually include the use of
simulated clear sky irradiance as baseline, that is combined with an
appropriate threshold or some other statistical characteristics, and in
some cases, with visual inspection of sky camera images (Vamvakas,
Salamalikis, and Kazantzidis 2020; Mol, Knap, and Van Heerwaarden 2023
and references therein).

In this study, we evaluate the effects CE on GHI by investigating their
frequency of occurrence, intensity, and duration in a thirty-year period
of GHI observations at Thessaloniki, Greece. We used modeled clear sky
irradiance as a baseline to identify cloud enhancements and we
determined long-term trends of the above mentioned metrics, their
climatology and some general characteristics. To our knowledge there are
no other studies that provide trends from such long dataset.

# 2 Data and methodology

## 2.1 Instrumentation and data

The data used in this study were recorded at the monitoring site of the
Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,
in Thessaloniki, Greece ($40^{\circ}\, 38\prime\,$N,
$22^{\circ}\, 57\prime\,$E, $80\,$m a.s.l.). The GHI data were measured
with a Kipp & Zonen CM-21 pyranometer and cover the period 13 April 1993
to 31 December 2023. During the study period, the pyranometer was
independently calibrated three times at the Meteorologisches
Observatorium Lindenberg, DWD, verifying that the stability of the
instrument's sensitivity was better than $0.7\,\%$ relative to the
initial calibration by the manufacturer. For the acquisition of
radiometric data, the signal of the pyranometer was sampled at a rate of
$1\,\text{Hz}$ with the mean and standard deviation of these samples
calculated and recorded every minute. The measurements were corrected
for the zero offset ("dark signal" in volts), which was calculated by
averaging all measurements recorded for a period of $3\,\text{h}$,
before (morning) or after (evening) the Sun reaches an elevation angle
of $- 10^{\circ}$. The signal was converted to irradiance using the
ramped value of the instrument's sensitivity between subsequent
calibrations.

To further improve the quality of the irradiance data, a manual
screening was performed, in order to remove inconsistent and erroneous
recordings that can occur stochastically or systematically during the
long operation of the instrument. The manual screening was aided by a
radiation data quality assurance procedure, adjusted for the site, which
was based on the methods of Long and Shi (Long and Shi 2006, 2008).
Thus, problematic recordings have been excluded from further processing.
Furthermore, due to the significant measurement uncertainty in GHI when
the Sun is near the horizon, and due to some systematic obstructions by
nearby buildings, we have excluded all measurements with solar zenith
angle (SZA) greater than $78^{\circ}$.

Finally, images from a sky camera have been used in the manual
inspection of the CE identification. The sky camera operates since 2012
and stores images in 5 min time steps.

## 2.2 Cloud enhancement detection

In this study, we define an event as CE when the measured GHI at ground
level, exceeds the expected value under clear-sky conditions. Similarly,
we define as extreme cloud enhancement events (ECE), the cases when GHI
at ground level exceeds the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). Although the
duration of these bursts can vary from seconds to several minutes, here
we are constrained by the temporal resolution of our data to identify
evens with duration of at minimum one-minute.

For the detection of CE cases we established a baseline of irradiance
above which we characterized each data point as an enhancement event and
calculated the over irradiance (OIR). The OIR is defined as the
irradiance difference of the measured one-minute GHI from the
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ corresponding to cloud-free atmosphere. First,
we tested two simple approaches for the determination of
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$: The Haurwitz's model (Haurwitz 1945), which
is a simple clear sky model and was already adjusted and applied to our
data (Natsis, Bais, and Meleti 2023), and the total solar irradiance
(TSI) at the top of the atmosphere, adjusted for the Sun-Earth distance.
We have tested both methods by using an appropriate relative threshold
and/or an additional constant offset. The initial results showed that we
can detect a big portion of the CE events. However, by inspecting the
daily plots of irradiance it became evident that changes in atmospheric
conditions introduced numerous false positive and false negative
results. The main reason for these discrepancies is the variability of
the effects of aerosols and water vapor which were not taken into
account in the two simple methods. To produce a more representative
reference we included the effects of these factors through variables
using a radiative transfer model (RTM). The applied methodology is
discussed in section..

## 2.3 Modeled clear Sky Irradiance

### 2.3.1 Climatology of clear sky irradiance

We approximated the expected clear sky $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ with
the radiative transfer model uvspec, part of libRadtran (Emde et al.
2016), similarly to the approach used by Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and
Kazantzidis (2020). In uvspec we used the solar spectrum of Kurucz
(1994) in the range $280$ to $2500\,\text{nm}$, the radiative trasfer
solver "disort" in "pseudospherical" geometry and the "LOWTRAN" gas
parameterization. The model was run for a range of variables in order to
create a look up table (LUT) for the estimation of the cloud-free
reference irradiance for each individual observation of our dataset. In
this context, the model was run for SZAs in the range $10$ --
$90^{\circ}$ with a step of ${0.2}^{\circ}$ and for the atmospheric
profiles of the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory (Anderson et al. 1986)
midlatitude summer and midlatitude winter, representative of the warm
and cold seasons.

Main factors responsible for the attenuation of the broadband downward
solar radiation under cloud free atmospheres are aerosols and water
vapor. At Thessaloniki, such measurements are available since 2003 from
the Cimel sun photometer that belongs to the Aerosol Robotic Network
(AERONET) (Giles et al. 2019; Buis et al. 1998). From the observations
in the period 2003 -- 2023 we calculated the monthly climatological
means and standard deviation ($\sigma$) for the aerosol optical depth
(AOD) at $500\,\text{nm}$ and the equivalent height of the water column
(WC). The monthly climatological values of AOD and water column, as well
as combinations with additional offsets of $\pm 1\sigma$ and
$\pm 2\sigma$ , were used as inputs to the RTM in the construction of
the LUT.

For each measurement of the dataset, we calculated from the LUT a
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ value for the respective season and SZA (by
linear interpolation), and for the climatological values of AOD and WC
of the respective month. The same procedure was followed for the
estimation of the $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ for all combinations of the
AOD and WC with the above mentioned standard deviation offsets. Finally,
each $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ value was adjusted to the actual
Sun-Earth distance derived by the Astropy software library (Astropy
Collaboration et al. 2022).

### 2.3.2 Long-term change of clear sky irradiance

The above clear sky reference values are based on the climatological AOD
and WC, hence they cannot describe accurately the long-term variation of
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ due to changes in the two atmospheric
constituents, mainly AOD. As reported by Natsis, Bais, and Meleti
(2023), there is a long-term brightening effect in the GHI data of
Thessaloniki for the period 1993 -- 2023, which for clear-sky data was
attributed to long-term changes in aerosol effects. Therefore, an
adjustment of the $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ during the period of study
was made using simulation with the RTM based on the long-term variations
of the AOD. As AERONET data start only in 2003, we used for the period
1993 -- 2005 estimates of changes in AOD at $340\,\text{nm}$ derived
from a collocated Brewer spectrophotometer (Kazadzis et al. 2007) to
calculate the trend in $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ during this period.

According to this study, in the period 1997 -- 2005 the mean AOD at
$340\,\text{nm}$ is $0.403$ with a trend of $- 3.8 \pm 0.93\,\%$ per
year, corresponding to a change of $0.0153$ per year. Using an Ångström
coefficient $\alpha = 1.6$, this translates to a change in the Ångström
coefficient $\beta = 0.00272$ per year (or $\beta = 0.084$ in 1997 and
$\beta = 0.059$ in 2005). Simulations with uvspec for the above Ångström
coefficients, with WC of $15.7\,\text{mm}$ and $15.4\,\text{mm}$ for
1997 and 2005 respectively, also taken from AERONET, and for a SZA of
$55^{\circ}$ reveal a trend of $+ 0.21\,\%$ per year in
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$. The SZA of $55^{\circ}$ was chosen as
representative of all days in the year in order to get a rough estimate
of the annually averaged change in clear sky irradiance. For the period
2005 -- 2023 we used the mean monthly values of AOD and WC from AERONET
in a similar simulation scheme to calculate the monthly mean of clear
sky irradiance, and finally the trend of $+ 0.14\,\%$ per year. We
applied these two long-term changes (see Figure) to the climatological
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$, in order to create a more realistic
representation of the clear-sky irradiance for the whole period of
study.

## 2.4 Criteria for the identification of CE events

In this study our main focus was to quantify over irradiance events
related to CEs. A key issue for achieving this goal is to define a
threshold for the CE identification, representative of the clear-sky
irradiance at the time of each GHI measurement. This depends on the
selection of the appropriate atmospheric parameterization for the RTM
simulations. The implementation of the long-term change of AOD,
discussed in section, allows capturing a large part of the natural
variability of clear-sky GHI. However, the short-term variability of AOD
cannot be taken adequately into account when using monthly values in the
model simulations. We tried different approaches in order to strengthen
the robustness of the methodology and compensate for the limited
accuracy of the RTM input data and the unpredictable natural variability
of the atmosphere.

First, we evaluated the performance of the modelled
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ in relation to the measured GHI for different
levels of atmospheric clearness, by using in the RTM the monthly
climatological AOD and WC, less their respective standard deviations.
These values represent typical atmospheres in Thessaloniki with lower
than average load of aerosols and humidity, which are the main factors
that attenuate the GHI, excluding clouds. With this approach the
simulated $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ should be generally greater than the
measured GHI when aerosols are more abundant. To compensate for this, we
defined the following threshold $E$ to compare the measured
$\text{GHI}$:

$$\text{CE}:E > 15 + 1.04 \cdot \text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}\,\,\left\lbrack \text{W}/\text{m}^{2} \right\rbrack$$

This is the criterion of our CE identification.

These values were determined through the implementation of an empirical
method with manual inspection of the CE identification results on
selected days of the whole dataset. We used seven sets of days with
characteristics relevant to the efficiency of the identification
threshold. These sets were random groups of about 20 -- 30 days with the
following characteristics: (a) the strongest over irradiance CE events,
(b) the largest daily total over irradiance, (c) absence of clouds (by
implementing a clear sky identification algorithm as discussed in
Natsis, Bais, and Meleti (2023)), (d) absence of clouds and absence of
EC events, (e) with at least $60\,\%$ of the day length without clouds
and presence of EC events, (h) randomly selected days, and (i) manually
selected days. For the latter case and where needed, we also used images
from a sky-camera to further aid the decision of the manual inspection.

The definition of the CE events with this method has a degree of
subjectivity, since the actual clear sky irradiance is not known and can
only be approximated. However, this method is capable in detecting all
major CE events. Where some CE events with very low OIR may be not
detected, these are few with small over-irradiance and it is unlikely
that will effect significantly our results.

A sub-category of the CE events that is often discussed in the relevant
literature (Cordero et al. 2023; Martins, Mantelli, and Rüther 2022;
Georgi Hristov Yordanov, Saetre, and Midtgård 2015), are the extreme
cloud enhancement (ECE) events. These are cases of CE where the measured
intensity of the irradiance exceeds the TSI at the top of the
atmosphere. In this case the threshold $E$ is given by:

$$\text{ECE}:E > \cos(\theta) \cdot E_{\odot}\frac{r_{\text{m}}^{2}}{r^{2}}$$

where: $\theta$ the solar zenith angle, $E_{\odot}$ the solar constant
adjusted for the actual Sun -- Earth distance $r$ and $r_{\text{m}}$ is
the mean Sun -- Earth distance of $1.496 \times 10^{8}\,\text{km}$.

An example of CE identification for a selected day is given in the
Figure, where the daily course of the clear sky reference irradiance and
the CE and ECE identification thresholds are shown along with the actual
GHI measurements. In addition, we provide an example scatter plot
between the measured and the modeled clear-sky irradiance for one year,
where the CE and ECE events are clearly grouped above the threshold of
irradiance (Figure).

# 3 Results

Following the application of the above discussed methodology to the
entire dataset (6.1 million of one-minute GHI measurements), $1.76\,\%$
were identified as CE events and $0.036\,\%$ as ECE events. The highest
recorded GHI due to CE was $1416.6\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$ on 24 May
2007, corresponding to OIR of $345.9\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. The
stronger CE event of $49.7\,\%$ above the clear sky threshold was
observed on 28 October 2016. In the following sections we are discussing
the long-term trends and variability of the CE events as well as of the
corresponding OIR and excess irradiation.

## 3.1 Long-term trends

The main focus of this study is to investigate the time evolution of the
CE events by analyzing the GHI measurements at Thessaloniki. Cloud
enhancements can be influenced by different factors, such as the
geometry, size and optical thickness of clouds, their height in the
atmosphere and on local weather regimes (Mol, Knap, and Van Heerwaarden
2023; Veerman, Van Stratum, and Van Heerwaarden 2022; Gristey et al.
2022; Tzoumanikas et al. 2016). Some of these factors are related to
changes in climate; hence it would be reasonable to expect capturing
their contributions to the frequency of occurrence of CE events over
Thessaloniki, as well as to the average OIR and excess irradiation. The
long-term trends were calculated using a first-order autoregressive
model with the 'maximum likelihood' fitting method (Gardner, Harvey, and
Phillips 1980; Jones 1980), by implementing the function 'arima' from
the library 'stats' of the R programming language (R Core Team 2023).
All trends are reported together with their $2\sigma$ error.

Figure shows the time series of the yearly number of CE cases (each with
duration of one minute), the yearly mean OIR and the yearly excess
irradiation for the period 1993 -- 2023, together with corresponding
linear trends. All three quantities show increasing trends, most
pronounced for the frequency of occurrence
($45.6 \pm 21.9\,\text{cases}/\text{year}$) and the excess irradiation
($116.9 \pm 67.8\,\text{kJ}/\text{year}$), which are also statistically
significant. In contrast the trend of the yearly mean OIR is negligible
($0.1 \pm 0.1\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}/\text{year}$) and of no statistical
significance. The average OIR for the entire period is
$39.9\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2} \pm 2.7\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. The
interannual variability of the data about the trend lines is quite
large. Furthermore, the spread tends to increase with time (at least for
the quantities of panels b and c), suggesting a significant variability
in cloud patterns over the area, possibly associated to changes in
climate.

We have to note that the excess irradiation related to the CE events can
not be directly linked to the total energy balance of the atmosphere.
The net solar radiation of the region is not increased, but is rather
redistributed through the CE events. This is also depicted by the ECE
irradiance values, which can exceed the equivalent clear sky irradiance
by a significant amount.

## 3.2 Climatology of cloud enhancement events

Another interesting aspect of the CE events is their distribution within
the year. Figure shows the monthly box and whisker plot of the CE number
of occurrence normalized with the highest median value, that occurs in
June, depicting a clear seasonal cycle. Although CE events are present
throughout the year, the most active months are May and June. During the
winter (December -- February), the number of CE cases is about $25\,\%$
of the maximum, while in the intermediate months, the number of
occurrences gradually ramps between the maximum and minimum. This
seasonality is a combined effect of different factors, among them the
types of clouds, their frequency of occurrence, the seasonally varying
relative position of the sun, as well as the local landscape
characteristics that may influence the formation of the clouds.
Unfortunately, lack of detailed data on cloud formation, type and
location is not allowing further analysis. The interannual variability
of the monthly CE events is quite high as manifested by the large
monthly extremes, especially in the summer.

![Figure 3.1: Seasonal variability of the number of CE events normalized
to the maximum occurring in June, in the form of a box and whisker plot.

of valid GHI observations. The box contains the data between the lower

respectively. The vertical lines (whiskers) extend between the maximum
and minimum monthly values and the solid circles are
outliers.](media/rId42.png){width="5.833333333333333in"

Figure 3.1: Seasonal variability of the number of CE events normalized
to the maximum occurring in June, in the form of a box and whisker plot.
The monthly values have been also normalized to the relative abundance
of valid GHI observations. The box contains the data between the lower
$25\,\%$ and the upper $75\,\%$ percentiles, the thick horizontal line
and the diamond symbol represent the median and the mean values,
respectively. The vertical lines (whiskers) extend between the maximum
and minimum monthly values and the solid circles are outliers.

The distribution of the number of CE events as a function of OIR is
shown in Figure. Apparently, there is an inverse relationship between
the frequency of CE events and OIR with an exponential-like decline.
This is expected, as the stronger the CE events are, the rarer the
conditions favoring the occurrence of CE events. For the majority (over
$62\,\%$) of the CE events the OIR is below the long-term average of
$39.9\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$, while about $8.1\,\%$ of the events
correspond to OIR larger than $100\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$ and up to the
highest value of $412.4\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. This distribution is
indicative of the magnitude and the probability of the expected CE
events over Thessaloniki. Similar distribution of CE events, albeit with
larger OIR values, has been reported by Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and
Kazantzidis (2020), for the city of Patras. This site is located
${2.5}^{\circ}$ south of Thessaloniki and is exposed to air masses
coming mainly from the eastern Mediterranean resulting in different
cloud patterns, that may affect the characteristics and magnitude of the
CE events.

## 3.3 Duration of cloud enhancement events

The duration of the CE events is variable and can last for several
minutes or even more than an hour. In order to study the characteristics
of these consecutive events, we grouped them into bins of increasing
duration in steps of one minute. We have identified 28468 groups of CE
in the whole period of study, where the group of the longest duration of
140 minutes occurred on 07 July 2013. Figure shows the frequency
distribution of the CE events according to their duration. We conclude
that although some groups of events last for more than an hour about
$80\,\%$ have duration of less than 5 minutes.

CE events according to their
duration.](media/rId51.png){width="5.833333333333333in"

Figure 3.3: Relative frequency distribution of CE groups of consequent
CE events according to their duration.

The relation between the duration and the mean OIR of the groups has
also been studied (Figure). Evidently, evens of high excess irradiation
have small duration and vice versa. The vast majority of grouped events
are associated with small excess irradiation
(e.g. $< 5\,\text{kJ}/\text{m}^{2}$) and small duration
(e.g. $< 5\,\text{min}$) while groups with strong excess irradiation and
long duration are very rare. Similar results of this relation have been
reported by Zhang et al. (2018), on a study using a far higher sampling
rate than ours.

## 3.4 Extreme cloud enhancement events

An aspect of the CE events that is commonly reported and has some
significance on the solar energy production infrastructure are the
extreme CE events (ECE). Where solar irradiance exceeds the expected
irradiance on top of the atmosphere (Equation). Analogous to Figure we
have computed the distribution of the number of occurrences of ECE
events by month in Figure. The most active period for ECE events is in
the spring and the start of the summer (March -- June), followed by a
period in the late fall (September and October). This is probably
related to the weather characteristics of these periods, where there are
continuous alternations between clear sky periods and clouds.

Figure 3.5: Seasonal variability of the number of ECE events normalized
to the maximum occurring in March, in the form of a box and whisker
plot. The box contains the data between the lower $25\,\%$ and the upper
$75\,\%$ percentiles. The thick horizontal line and the diamond symbol
represent the median and the mean values, respectively. The vertical
lines (whiskers) extend between the maximum and minimum monthly values.

The distribution of the ECE events (Figure), shows that there are rare
cases where the OIR can exceed the TSI even more than
$400\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$, with the $75\,\%$ of the cases to be below
$200\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. Those finds are in accordance with results
form Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and Kazantzidis (2020), with the difference
that the OIR values are lower for Thessaloniki.

# 4 Conclusions

By creating a clear sky approximation of the GHI, which represents the
long- and short-term variation of the expected clear sky GHI, we were
able to identify cases of CE events. After analyzing the CE cases, we
found an increase of $45.6 \pm 21.9\,\text{cases}/\text{year}$, with the
mean annual total energy of the CE events increasing with a rate of
$116.9 \pm 67.8\,\text{kJ}/\text{year}$. The most active season of CE
events over Thessaloniki is concentrated on early summer, on May and
June.

The magnitude of the ECE events does not exceeds the values reported for
sites with more favourable conditions for the phenomenon. The
climatological characteristic of the ECE events, showed that the most
active months are spread on half of the year (March -- June and
September and October). We found that CE conditions, can have a duration
of more than an hour in rare cases, with the bulk of the cases having a
duration under 5 minutes. Some of the characteristics of CE and ECE
events we analysed, have strong similarities with results by Vamvakas,
Salamalikis, and Kazantzidis (2020), for a city southern of
Thessaloniki, with the analogues differences on the intensity of the
solar radiation.

An interpretation of the CE trends, shows that the interaction of GHI
with the clouds, through this 30 year period, is a dynamic phenomenon
that's needs further investigation. Although, to approach it, we need
more long-term observations of AOD and clouds characteristics.
