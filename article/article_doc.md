title: Long term cloud enhancement events of global solar irradiance
  over Thessaloniki, Greece
---

# Abstract

We studied the enhancement of the global horizontal irradiance (GHI),
over Thessaloniki, for the period 1993 -- 2023, on one minute average
records. We identify the cloud enhancement events (CE), by creating an
appropriate clear sky irradiance reference with the use of a radiation
transfer model, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, from the AERONET,
and a collocated Brewer photospectrometer. We found that there is a
trend of CE cases of $45.6 \pm 21.9\,\text{cases}/\text{year}$, and a
mean total energy change, of the CE events by
$116.9 \pm 67.8\,\text{kj}/\text{year}$ with the peak of the CE events
are observed during May and June. An analysis of the total duration of
CE events, showed that durations longer than 5 minutes are very rare,
with exceptions lasting over an hour. We have detected enhancements over
the total solar irradiance, without exceeding the maximum values
reported for other sites, with more favorable CE conditions.

# 1 Introduction

The shortwave solar radiation, reaching Earth's surface, is the main
energy source of the atmosphere and the biosphere, and drives and
governs the climate (Gray et al. 2010). It has direct practical
application in industries like energy and agricultural production. The
variability of its intensity can impose difficulties in predicting the
yield and in designing the specifications of the appropriate equipment.
Significant portion of research has been focused on predicting the
renewable energy production in a fine timescale and in near real-time
(for a review see Inman, Pedro, and Coimbra (2013); Graabak and Korpås
(2016)).

An important aspect of the variability of solar radiation is its
interaction with the clouds. In general, clouds can attenuate a fraction
of solar irradiance, but under certain conditions, can lead to
enhancement of the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) reaching the
ground. This effect can locally increase the observed GHI to levels even
higher than the expected clear-sky irradiance (Cordero et al. 2023;
Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and Kazantzidis 2020; Castillejo-Cuberos and
Escobar 2020; Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and Kazantzidis 2020 and references
therein).

Some of the proposed underling mechanisms of those enhancements, have
been summarized by Gueymard (2017); the most important being the
scattering of radiation on the edges of cumulus clouds. It has been also
suggested that enhancement of GHI can be produced by thin cirrus clouds
though refraction and scattering (Thuillier et al. 2013). Further
investigation with radiative transfer modeling and observations pointed
as the prevailing mechanism, the strong forward Mie scattering through
clouds of low optical depth (Pecenak et al. 2016; Thuillier et al. 2013;
G. H. Yordanov et al. 2013; Georgi Hristov Yordanov, Saetre, and
Midtgård 2015). Overall, enhancement event depend on different
interactive factors, which include cloud thickness, structure and type,
and the relative position of the sun and the clouds (Gueymard 2017;
Veerman, Van Stratum, and Van Heerwaarden 2022).

On multiple sites, cloud enhancements (CE) have been reported to be able
to briefly exceed the value of the solar constant, resulting of
clearness indices above unit. A summary of extreme enchantment cases
(ECE) has been compiled by Martins, Mantelli, and Rüther (2022). There
are also some practical implications of the cloud enchantments. The
intensity and duration of enhancements can effect the efficiency and
stability of photovoltaic power production (Lappalainen and Kleissl
2020; Järvelä and Valkealahti 2020) while ECEs have the potential to
compromise the integrity of photovoltaic plants infrastructure (Do
Nascimento et al. 2019). It has also been demonstrated that these events
can interfere in the comparison of ground-based and satellite
observations (Damiani et al. 2018). Global warming has likely affected
cloud coverage in the last few decades. Liu et al. (2023) reported
increases in cloud cover over the tropical and subtropical oceans and
decreases over most continents, while Dong, Sutton, and Wilcox (2023)
reported decreases over North America and Europe. To our knowledge,
there is no evidence on whether this trend has affected also the number
and strength of CE events.

Methods of identification of CE events usually include the use of
simulated clear sky irradiance as baseline, that is combined with an
appropriate threshold or some other statistical characteristics, and in
some cases, with visual inspection of sky camera images (Vamvakas,
Salamalikis, and Kazantzidis 2020; Mol, Knap, and Van Heerwaarden 2023
and references therein).

In this study, we evaluate the effects CE on GHI by investigating their
frequency of occurrence, intensity, and duration in a thirty-year period
of GHI observations at Thessaloniki, Greece. We used modeled clear sky
irradiance as a baseline to identify cloud enhancements and we
determined long term trends of the above mentioned metrics, their
climatology and some general characteristics. To our knowledge there are
no other studies that provide trends from such long dataset.

In this study, we define an event as CE when the measured GHI at ground
level, exceeds the expected value under clear-sky conditions. Similarly,
we define as extreme cloud enhancement events (ECE), the cases when GHI
at ground level exceeds the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). Although the
duration of these bursts can vary from seconds to several minutes, here
we are constrained by the temporal resolution of our data to identify
evens with duration of at minimum one-minute.

# 2 Data and methodology

## 2.1 Instrumentation and data

The data used in this study were recorded at the monitoring site of the
Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,
in Thessaloniki, Greece ($40^{\circ}\, 38\prime\,$N,
$22^{\circ}\, 57\prime\,$E, $80\,$m a.s.l.). The GHI data were measured
with a Kipp & Zonen CM-21 pyranometer and cover the period 13 April 1993
to 31 December 2023. During the study period, the pyranometer was
independently calibrated three times at the Meteorologisches
Observatorium Lindenberg, DWD, verifying that the stability of the
instrument's sensitivity was better than $0.7\,\%$ relative to the
initial calibration by the manufacturer. For the acquisition of
radiometric data, the signal of the pyranometer was sampled at a rate of
$1\,\text{Hz}$ with the mean and standard deviation of these samples
calculated and recorded every minute. The measurements were corrected
for the zero offset ("dark signal" in volts), which was calculated by
averaging all measurements recorded for a period of $3\,\text{h}$,
before (morning) or after (evening) the Sun reaches an elevation angle
of $- 10^{\circ}$. The signal was converted to irradiance using the
ramped value of the instrument's sensitivity between subsequent
calibrations.

To further improve the quality of the irradiance data, a manual
screening was performed, in order to remove inconsistent and erroneous
recordings that can occur stochastically or systematically during the
long operation of the instrument. The manual screening was aided by a
radiation data quality assurance procedure, adjusted for the site, which
was based on the methods of Long and Shi (Long and Shi 2006, 2008).
Thus, problematic recordings have been excluded from further processing.
Although it is impossible to detect all false data, the large number of
available data, and the aggregation scheme we used, ensures the quality
of the radiation measurements used in this study. To preserve an
unbiased representation of the data we applied a constraint, similar the
one used by Castillejo-Cuberos and Escobar (2020). For each valid hour
of day, there must exist at least 45 minutes of valid measurements,
including nighttime, when near sunrise and sunset. Days with less than 5
valid hours were rejected completely. Furthermore, due to the
significant measurement uncertainty in GHI when the Sun is near the
horizon, and due to some systematic obstructions by nearby buildings, we
have excluded all measurements with solar zenith angle (SZA) greater
than $78^{\circ}$.

Finally, images from a sky camera have been used in the manual
inspection of the CE identification. The sky camera operates since 2012
and stores images in 5 min time steps.

## 2.2 Cloud enhancement detection

For the detection of CE cases we established a baseline of irradiance
above which we characterized each data point as an enhancement event and
calculated the over irradiance (OIR). The OIR is defined as the
irradiance difference of the measured one-minute $\text{GHI}_{i}$ from
the $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ corresponding to cloud-free atmosphere.
First, we tested two simple approaches for the determination of
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$: The Haurwitz's model (Haurwitz 1945), which
is a simple clear sky model and was already adjusted and applied to our
data (Natsis, Bais, and Meleti 2023), and the total solar irradiance
(TSI) at the top of the atmosphere, adjusted for the Sun-Earth distance.
We have tested both methods by using an appropriate relative threshold
and/or an additional constant offset. The initial results showed that we
can detect a big portion of the CE events. However, by inspecting the
daily plots of irradiance it became evident that changes in atmospheric
conditions introduced numerous false positive and false negative
results. The main reason for these discrepancies is the variability of
the effects of aerosols and water vapor which were not taken into
account in the two simple methods. To produce a more representative
reference we included the effects of these factors through variables
using a radiative transfer model (RTM). The applied methodology is
discussed in section

## 2.3 Modeled clear Sky Irradiance

### 2.3.1 Climatology of clear sky irradiance

We approximated the expected clear sky $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ with
the radiative transfer model uvspec, part of libRadtran (Emde et al.
2016), similarly to the approach used by Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and
Kazantzidis (2020). In uvspec we used the solar spectrum of Kurucz
(1994) in the range $280$ to $2500\,\text{nm}$, the radiative trasfer
solver "disort" in "pseudospherical" geometry and the "LOWTRAN" gas
parameterization. The model was run for a range of variables in order to
create a look up table (LUT) for the estimation of the cloud-free
reference irradiance for each individual observation of our dataset. In
this context, the model was run for SZAs in the range $10$ --
$90^{\circ}$ with a step of ${0.2}^{\circ}$ and for the atmospheric
profiles of the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory (Anderson et al. 1986)
midlatitude summer and midlatitude winter, representative of the warm
and cold seasons.

Main factors responsible for the attenuation of the broadband downward
solar radiation under cloud free atmospheres are aerosols and water
vapor. At Thessaloniki, such measurements are available since 2003 from
the Cimel sun photometer that belongs to the Aerosol Robotic Network
(AERONET) (Giles et al. 2019; Buis et al. 1998). From the observations
in the period 2003 -- 2023 we calculated the monthly climatological
means and standard deviation ($\sigma$) for the aerosol optical depth
(AOD) at $500\,\text{nm}$ and the equivalent height of the water column
(WC). The monthly climatological values of AOD and water column, as well
as combinations with additional offsets of $\pm 1\sigma$ and
$\pm 2\sigma$ , were used as inputs to the RTM in the construction of
the LUT.

For each measurement of the dataset, we calculated from the LUT a
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ value for the respective season and SZA (by
linear interpolation), and for the climatological values of AOD and WC
of the respective month. The same procedure was followed for the
estimation of the $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ for all combinations of the
AOD and WC with the above mentioned standard deviation offsets. Finally,
each $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ value was adjusted to the actual
Sun-Earth distance derived by the Astropy software library (Astropy
Collaboration et al. 2022).

### 2.3.2 Long term change of clear sky irradiance

The above clear sky reference values are based on the climatological AOD
and WC, hence they cannot describe accurately the long term variation of
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ due to changes in the two atmospheric
constituents, mainly AOD. As reported by Natsis, Bais, and Meleti
(2023), there is a long term brightening effect in the GHI data of
Thessaloniki for the period 1993 -- 2023, which for clear-sky data was
attributed to long-term changes in aerosol effects. Therefore, an
adjustment of the $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ used in this study is
necessary. As AERONET data start only in 2003, we used for the period
1993 --- 2005 estimates of changes in AOD at $340\,\text{nm}$ derived
from a collocated Brewer spectrophotometer derived from two sources. For
1993 -- 2005 (Kazadzis et al. 2007) to calculate the trend in
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ during this period.

To create a unified trend for the long term change of the clear sky
irradiance, we simulated the values of AOD derived from those sources
with Libradtran. For both inputs, we used the AOD at $500\,\text{nm}$,
which was inferred by the available Ångström coefficients. We choose the
SZA of $55^{\circ}$ as a representative value for all the runs.

According to this study, in the period 1997 -- 2005 the mean AOD at
$340\,\text{nm}$ $0.403$ with a trend of $- 3.8 \pm 0.93\,\%$ per year,
corresponding to a change of $0.0153$ per year. Using an Ångström
coefficient $\alpha = 1.6$, this translates to a change in the Ångström
coefficient $\beta = 0.00272$ per year (or $\beta = 0.084$ in 1997 and
$\beta = 0.059$ in 2005). Simulations with uvspec for the above Ångström
coefficients, with WC of $15.7\,\text{mm}$ and $15.4\,\text{mm}$ for
1997 and 2005 respectively and for a SZA of $55^{\circ}$ reveal trend of
$+ 0.21\,\%$ per year in $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$. The SZA of
$55^{\circ}$ was chosen as representative of all days in the year in
order to get a rough estimate of the annually averaged change in clear
sky irradiance. For the period 2005 -- 2023 we used the mean monthly
values of AOD and WC from AERONET in a similar simulation scheme to
calculate the monthly mean of clear sky irradiance, and finally the
trend of $+ 0.14\,\%$ per year. We applied these two long term changes
(see Figure) to the climatological $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$, in order
to create a more realistic representation of the clear-sky irradiance
for the whole period of study.

## 2.4 Criteria for the identification of CE events

In this study our main focus was to quantify over irradiance events
related to CEs. A key issue for achieving this goal is to define a
threshold for the CE identification, representative of the clear-sky
irradiance at the time of each GHI measurement. This depends on the
selection of the appropriate atmospheric parameterization for the RTM
simulations. The implementation of the long term change of AOD,
discussed in section, allows capturing a large part of the natural
variability of clear-sky GHI. However, the short-term variability of AOD
cannot be taken adequately into account when using monthly values for
the model simulations. We tried different approaches to increase the
robustness of the methodology and compensate for the limited accuracy of
the RTM input data and the unpredictable natural variability of the
atmosphere.

First, we evaluated the performance of the modelled
$\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ in relation to the measured GHI for different
levels of atmospheric clearness, by using in the RTM the monthly
climatological AOD and WC, less their respective standard deviations.
These values represent typical atmosphere in Thessaloniki, with lower
than average load of aerosols and humidity, which are the main factor
that attenuate the GHI, excluding clouds. With this approach the
simulated $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ should be generally greater than the
measured GHI when aerosols are more abundant. To compensate for this, we
increased the $\text{GHI}_{\text{ref}}$ by ($4\,\%$) with an additional
constant offset of $15\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$, as described in
Equation.

$$\text{CE}:\text{E}_{\text{i}} > 15 + 1.04 \cdot \text{E}_{\text{CSm,i}}\,\,\left\lbrack \text{W}/\text{m}^{2} \right\rbrack$$

where: $\text{E}$ the measured irradiance, $\text{E}_{\text{CSm}}$ the
selected modelled clear sky irradiance, and $i$ each of the one-minute
observation. This is the criterion of our CE identification.

These values were determined through the implementation of an empirical
method with manual inspection of the CE identification results on
selected days of the whole dataset. We used seven sets of days with
characteristics relevant to the efficiency of the identification
threshold. These sets were random groups of about 20 -- 30 days with the
following characteristics: (a) the strongest over irradiance CE events,
(b) the largest daily total over irradiance, (c) absence of clouds (by
implementing a clear sky identification algorithm as discussed in
Natsis, Bais, and Meleti (2023)), (d) absence of clouds and absence of
EC events, (e) with at least $60\,\%$ of the day length without clouds
and presence of EC events, (h) randomly selected days, and (i) manually
selected days. Where needed in some of the edge cases, we also used
images from a sky-camera to further aid the decision of the manual
inspection.

The definition of the CE events with this method has a degree of
subjectivity, since the actual clear sky irradiance, is not known and
can only be approximated. However, this method is capable in detecting
all major CE events. Where, some CE events, with very low OIR may be not
detected, these are few with small over-irradiance and it is unlikely
that will effect significantly our results.

A sub-category of the CE events that is often discussed in the relevant
bibliography (Cordero et al. 2023; Martins, Mantelli, and Rüther 2022;
Georgi Hristov Yordanov, Saetre, and Midtgård 2015), are the extreme
cloud enhancement (ECE) events. These are cases of CE where the measured
intensity of the irradiance, exceeds the TSI at the top of the
atmosphere:

$$\text{ECE}:\text{GHI}_{\text{i}} > \cos(\theta) \times E_{i \odot}/r_{i}^{2}$$

where: $\theta$ the solar zenith angle, $E_{\odot}$ the solar constant
adjusted for the actual Sun -- Earth distance, and $i$ each of the
one-minute observation.

An example of CE identification for a selected day is given, in the
Appendix (Figure), where the clear sky reference irradiance and the CE
and ECE identification thresholds are shown along with the actual GHI
measurements. Similar, we provided an example plot of data for one year,
where the relation of the GHI and clear sky reference is shown, along
with the OIR intensity (Appendix Figure).

# 3 Results

Our dataset, after the data selection processing, consists of 6144534
records of GHI measurements, of which $1.764\,\%$ were identified as CE
events and $0.036\,\%$ as ECE events. The highest recorded GHI due to CE
was $1416.6\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$ on 24 May 2007, and had the maximum
value of OIR at $345.9\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. The relative stronger CE
event was $49.7\,\%$ above the clear sky threshold, on 28 October 2016.

## 3.1 Long term trends

We computed the daily trend of the mean OIR of CE using a first-order
autoregressive model with a lag of one day, with the 'maximum
likelihood' fitting method (Gardner, Harvey, and Phillips 1980; Jones
1980) by implementing the function 'arima' from the library 'stats' of
the R programming language (R Core Team 2023). The trends are reported
together with the $2\sigma$ error. We observed a negligible change of
$0.087 \pm 0.08\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}/\text{year}$ on the mean OIR.
Although, the previous result is closer to the raw data, we preferred to
present the annual statistics, that give a more clear picture about the
long term CE trends. Hence, we calculated the annual values from the
one-minute measurements. Despite the very weak statistical significance
of the mean OIR trend, the annual number of CE occurrences shows a
steady increase of $45.6 \pm 21.9\,\text{cases}/\text{year}$ (Figure).
Subsequently, the mean annual energy of the CE events is increasing with
a rate of $116.9 \pm 67.8\,\text{kj}/\text{year}$ (Figure ), witch
follows the trend of the number of CE occurrences. We have to note that
the energy related to the CE events can not be directly linked with the
total energy balance of the atmosphere. The net solar radiation of the
region is not increased, but rather redistributed through the CE events.
This also is depicted by the "instantaneous" values of irradiance
(average over one minute), that can exceed the equivalent clear sky
irradiance to a considerable level.

## 3.2 Cloud enhancements climatology

Another interesting aspect of the CE cases occurrences, is their
seasonal cycle. In Figure, we have the monthly box plot (whisker plot),
where the values have been normalized by the highest median value, that
occurs on June. Although the number of occurrences has a wide spread
throughout the study period, the most active period of CE occurrences is
during May and June. During the Winter (December -- February) the CE
cases are about $25\,\%$ of the maximum. For the rest months, the
occurrences gradually ramp between the maximum and minimum. This
seasonality is a combinations of the clouds occurrences, and the
relevant position of the sun during each season of the year.
Unfortunately, the lack of detailed data on cloud formation, type and
location is not allowing further analysis.

each month, normalized to the maximum occurrences on June. The box
represents the values of the low 25\\,\\% percentile to 75\\,\\%

The distribution of the OIR intensity, follows an exponential decline
Figure, where there is an inverse relation between the CE events
frequency and their intensity. This is expected, as the stronger the CE
events become, the rarer the particular atmospheric and sun conditions
can occur. This fact, is indicative to the magnitude and the probability
of the expected OIRs events over Thessaloniki. Similar distribution of
CE occurrences have been reported by Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and
Kazantzidis (2020), where the magnitude of OIR were higher due to the
location of the city of Patras, ${2.5}^{\circ}$ closer to the equator.

## 3.3 Groups of cloud enhancement

In order to study the total duration of the CE events, we grouped the
one minute CE events to continuous CE groups (CEG). Thus, a CEG consists
of one or more successive CE cases, and can represent cloud enhancement
conditions spanning a duration of multiple minutes. We have identified
28468 groups of CE in the whole period of study, where the group with
the longest duration lasted 140 minutes on 07 July 2013. By examining
the frequency distribution of the CEG durations (Figure), we can
conclude, that although we detected some CEG with durations longer than
an hour, about $80\,\%$ of the CEG have a duration of less than 5
minutes.

![Figure 3.6: Distribution of CE groups duration in
minutes.](media/rId62.png){width="5.833333333333333in"
height="3.6591983814523186in"}

Figure 3.6: Distribution of CE groups duration in minutes.

The relation between the duration and the mean OIR intensity of the
groups have also been studied (Figure). We observed that the GCE events
tend to have either long duration, or large intensity. Events with
strong enhancement and long duration are very rare. Similar results on
this relation, have been reported by Zhang et al. (2018), on a study
using a far higher sampling rate than ours.

## 3.4 Extreme cloud enhancement events

An aspect of the CE events that is commonly reported and has some
significance on the solar energy production infrastructure are the
extreme CE events (ECE). Where solar irradiance exceeds the expected
irradiance on top of the atmosphere (Equation). Analogous to Figure we
have computed the distribution of the number of occurrences of ECE
events by month in Figure. The most active period for ECE events is in
the spring and the start of the summer (March -- June), followed by a
period in the late fall (September and October). This is probably
related to the weather characteristics of these periods, where there are
continuous alternations between clear sky periods and clouds.

![Figure 3.8: Seasonal statistics of the number of ECE occurancies for
each month, normalized to the maximum occurancies on March. The box
represents the values of the low 25\\,\\% percentile to 75\\,\\%
percentile, where the thick horizontal line inside is the mean, the

mean.](media/rId71.png){width="5.833333333333333in"

each month, normalized to the maximum occurancies on March. The box

percentile, where the thick horizontal line inside is the mean, the
vertical lines extend to the max imum and minimum vales, the dots are
outlier values, and the rhombus is the mean.

The distribution of the ECE events (Figure), shows that there are rare
cases where the OIR can exceed the TSI even more than
$400\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$, with the $75\,\%$ of the cases to be below
$200\,\text{W}/\text{m}^{2}$. Those finds are in accordance with results
form Vamvakas, Salamalikis, and Kazantzidis (2020), with the difference
that the OIR values are lower for Thessaloniki.

# 4 Discussion and conclusions

By creating a clear sky approximation of the GHI, which represents the
long- and short-term variation of the expected clear sky GHI, we were
able to identify cases of CE events. After analyzing the CE cases, we
found an increase of $45.6 \pm 21.9\,\text{cases}/\text{year}$, with the
mean annual total energy of the CE events increasing with a rate of
$116.9 \pm 67.8\,\text{kj}/\text{year}$. The most active season of CE
events over Thessaloniki is concentrated on early summer, on May and
June.

The magnitude of the ECE events doesn't exceeds the values reported from
sites with more favourable conditions for the phenomenon. Although, the
climatological characteristic of the ECE events, showed that the most
active months are spread on half of the year (March -- June and
September and October). We found that CE conditions, can have a duration
of more than an hour in rare cases, with the bulk of the cases having a
duration under 5 minutes. Some of the characteristics of CE and ECE
events we analysed, have strong similarities with results by Vamvakas,
Salamalikis, and Kazantzidis (2020), for a city southern of
Thessaloniki, with the analogues differences on the intensity of the
solar radiation.

An interpretation of the CE trends, shows that the interaction of GHI
with the clouds, through this 30 year period, is a dynamic phenomenon
that's needs further investigation. Although, to approach it, we need
more long term observations of AOD and clouds characteristics.
